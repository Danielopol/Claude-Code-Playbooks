| 1-6 months | X | X GB |
| 6-12 months | X | X GB |
| >1 year | X | X GB |

### By Type
| Type | Count | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| Images | X | X GB |
| Documents | X | X GB |
| Videos | X | X GB |

| Other | X | X GB |

### Quick Wins Identified
- [ ] [X] obvious duplicates ([size] recoverable)
- [ ] [X] empty folders

## Instructions

1. Point me to the folder to declutter
2. I'll do a quick assessment
3. Review safe delete recommendations
4. Make quick decisions on flagged items
5. Finish with organization

## Commands

```
"Declutter my Downloads folder"
"Quick cleanup of Desktop"
"Find duplicates in [folder]"
"What can I safely delete?"
"How much space can I recover?"
"7-minute cleanup, go!"
```

## Safety Rules

### Never Auto-Delete
- Work documents without backup
- Photos without duplicates elsewhere
- Anything in protected folders
- Files accessed in last 7 days

### Always Confirm
- Files over 500MB
- Anything with "backup" in name
- Folders with many files
- Files in non-standard locations
