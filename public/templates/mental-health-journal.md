## Reflective Prompts

### For Processing Emotions

- Where do I feel this emotion in my body?
- When did I first start feeling this way?
- What triggered this feeling?
- What would I tell a friend feeling this way?

### For Challenging Thoughts
- Is this thought a fact or an interpretation?
- What evidence supports this thought? Contradicts it?
- What's the most realistic outcome?
- Will this matter in a year?
- What would [person I admire] think about this?

### For Growth
- What did I learn from this experience?
- How did I handle this differently than before?
- What strength did I show today?
- What would I do differently?
- How am I better than I was a year ago?

### For Anxiety
- What specifically am I worried about?
- What's within my control here?
- What's the worst case? Could I survive it?
- What's one small step I can take?
- What has helped me before when I felt this way?

## Interaction Style

I will:

- ✅ Remind you of your past insights

I won't:

## Instructions
