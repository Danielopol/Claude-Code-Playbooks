## What You Need to Provide

### Step 1: Your Pipeline Data

**Option A: Upload a CSV**
Export your pipeline from your CRM. At minimum, include:
- Deal/Opportunity name
- Amount
- Stage
- Close date

Helpful extras: Owner, Last activity date, Created date, Account name

**Option B: Paste your deals**
```
Acme Corp - $50K - Negotiation - closes Jan 31
TechStart - $25K - Demo scheduled - closes Feb 15
BigCo - $100K - Discovery - closes Mar 30
```

**Option C: Describe your territory**
"I have 8 deals in pipeline totaling $400K. Two are in negotiation ($120K), three in evaluation ($180K), three in discovery ($100K)."

### Step 2: Your Targets

- **Quota**: What's your number? (e.g., "$500K this quarter")
- **Timeline**: When does the period end? (e.g., "Q1 ends March 31")
- **Already closed**: How much have you already booked this period?

| Deal | Amount | Risk | Recommendation |
|------|--------|------|----------------|
| [Deal] | $[X] | Close date passed | Update close date or move to lost |
| [Deal] | $[X] | No activity in 14+ days | Re-engage or downgrade stage |
| [Deal] | $[X] | Close date this week, still in discovery | Unlikely to close — push out |

## Gap Analysis

**To hit quota, you need:** $[X] more

**Options to close the gap:**
1. **Accelerate [Deal]** — Currently [stage], worth $[X]. If you can close by [date], you're at [X]% of quota.
2. **Revive [Stalled Deal]** — Last active [date]. Worth $[X].
3. **New pipeline needed** — You need $[X] in new opportunities at [X]x coverage to be safe.

## Recommendations

1. [ ] [Specific action for highest-impact deal]
2. [ ] [Action for at-risk deal]
3. [ ] [Pipeline generation recommendation if gap exists]
```

## Stage Probabilities (Default)

| Stage | Default Probability |
|-------|---------------------|
| Closed Won | 100% |
| Negotiation / Contract | 80% |
| Proposal / Quote | 60% |
| Evaluation / Demo | 40% |
| Discovery / Qualification | 20% |
| Prospecting / Lead | 10% |

Tell the assistant if your stages or probabilities are different.

## Tips

1. **Be honest about commit** — Only commit deals you'd bet on. Upside is for everything else.
2. **Update close dates** — Stale close dates kill forecast accuracy. Push out deals that won't close in time.
3. **Coverage matters** — 3x pipeline coverage is healthy. Below 2x is risky.
4. **Activity = signal** — Deals with no recent activity are at higher risk than stage suggests.
