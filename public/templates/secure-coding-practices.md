# Secure Coding Practices

Security-first development practices. Treat every external input as hostile, every secret as sacred, and every authorization check as mandatory. Security isn't a phase — it's a constraint on every line of code that touches user data, authentication, or external systems.

## When to Use

- Building anything that accepts user input
- Implementing authentication or authorization
- Storing or transmitting sensitive data
- Integrating with external APIs or services
- Adding file uploads, webhooks, or callbacks
- Handling payment or PII data

## Process: Threat Model First

Controls bolted on without a threat model are guesses. Before hardening anything, spend five minutes thinking like an attacker:

1. **Map the trust boundaries.** Where does untrusted data cross into the system? HTTP requests, form fields, file uploads, webhooks, third-party APIs, message queues, and **LLM output** — plus local values that look internal because the OS handed them over: another process's command line or environment, filenames on a shared volume, a path in a job payload. Trust follows who *wrote* a value, not which channel delivered it. Every boundary is attack surface.
2. **Name the assets.** What's worth stealing or breaking? Credentials, PII, payment data, admin actions, money movement.
3. **Run STRIDE over each boundary** — a quick lens, not a ceremony:

| Threat | Ask | Typical mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **S**poofing | Can someone impersonate a user/service? | Authentication, signature verification |
| **T**ampering | Can data be altered in transit or at rest? | Integrity checks, parameterized queries, HTTPS |
| **R**epudiation | Can an action be denied later? | Audit logging of security events |
| **I**nformation disclosure | Can data leak? | Encryption, field allowlists, generic errors |
| **D**enial of service | Can it be overwhelmed? | Rate limiting, input size caps, timeouts |
| **E**levation of privilege | Can a user gain rights they shouldn't? | Authorization checks, least privilege |

4. **Write abuse cases next to use cases.** For each feature, ask "how would I misuse this?" — then make that your first test.

If you can't name the trust boundaries for a feature, you're not ready to secure it. Most breaches begin in design, not code.

## The Three-Tier Boundary System

### Always Do (No Exceptions)

- **Validate all external input** at the system boundary (API routes, form handlers)
- **Parameterize all database queries** — never concatenate user input into SQL
- **Encode output** to prevent XSS (use framework auto-escaping, don't bypass it)
- **Use HTTPS** for all external communication
- **Hash passwords** with bcrypt/scrypt/argon2 (never store plaintext)
- **Set security headers** (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- **Use httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies** for sessions
- **Run the project's package-manager audit** against the committed lockfile before every release

### Ask First (Requires Human Approval)

- Adding new authentication flows or changing auth logic
- Storing new categories of sensitive data (PII, payment info)
- Adding new external service integrations
- Changing CORS configuration
- Adding file upload handlers
- Modifying rate limiting or throttling
- Granting elevated permissions or roles

### Never Do

- **Never commit secrets** to version control (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **Never log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, full credit card numbers)
- **Never trust client-side validation** as a security boundary
- **Never disable security headers** for convenience
- **Never use `eval()` or `innerHTML`** with user-provided data
- **Never store sessions in client-accessible storage** (localStorage for auth tokens)
- **Never expose stack traces** or internal error details to users

## Prevention Patterns by Vulnerability Class

### Injection (SQL, NoSQL, OS Command)

```typescript
// BAD: SQL injection via string concatenation
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '${userId}'`;

// GOOD: Parameterized query
const user = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [userId]);

// GOOD: ORM with parameterized input
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });
```

### Broken Authentication

```typescript
import { hash, compare } from 'bcrypt';

const SALT_ROUNDS = 12;
const hashedPassword = await hash(plaintext, SALT_ROUNDS);
const isValid = await compare(plaintext, hashedPassword);

app.use(session({
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,  // From environment, not code
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: true,
    sameSite: 'lax',
    maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
  },
}));
```

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

```typescript
// BAD
element.innerHTML = userInput;

// GOOD: framework auto-escaping (React does this by default)
return <div>{userInput}</div>;

// If you MUST render HTML, sanitize first
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
const clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
```

### Broken Access Control

```typescript
app.patch('/api/tasks/:id', authenticate, async (req, res) => {
  const task = await taskService.findById(req.params.id);

  // Check authorization, not just authentication
  if (task.ownerId !== req.user.id) {
    return res.status(403).json({
      error: { code: 'FORBIDDEN', message: 'Not authorized to modify this task' }
    });
  }

  const updated = await taskService.update(req.params.id, req.body);
  return res.json(updated);
});
```

### Security Misconfiguration

```typescript
import helmet from 'helmet';
app.use(helmet());

app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
    styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
    imgSrc: ["'self'", 'data:', 'https:'],
    connectSrc: ["'self'"],
  },
}));

app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || 'http://localhost:3000',
  credentials: true,
}));
```

### Sensitive Data Exposure

```typescript
function sanitizeUser(user: UserRecord): PublicUser {
  const { passwordHash, resetToken, ...publicFields } = user;
  return publicFields;
}

const API_KEY = process.env.STRIPE_API_KEY;
if (!API_KEY) throw new Error('STRIPE_API_KEY not configured');
```

### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Any time the server fetches a URL a user influenced — webhooks, "import from URL", image proxies, link previews — an attacker can aim it at internal services (cloud metadata, `localhost`, private IPs).

```typescript
// BAD: fetch whatever the user gives you
await fetch(req.body.webhookUrl);

// GOOD: allowlist scheme + host, reject if ANY resolved IP is private, forbid redirects
import { lookup } from 'node:dns/promises';
import ipaddr from 'ipaddr.js';

async function safeFetch(rawUrl: string) {
  const url = new URL(rawUrl);
  if (!['http:', 'https:'].includes(url.protocol)) throw new Error('Blocked scheme');

  const { address } = await lookup(url.hostname);
  const addr = ipaddr.parse(address);
  if (addr.range() !== 'unicast') throw new Error('Blocked internal address');

  return fetch(url.toString(), { redirect: 'error' });
}
```

## Dependency and Supply-Chain Hygiene

- Run the ecosystem's native audit command (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit`, `bundle audit`) against the committed lockfile before every release, not on an ad-hoc basis.
- Pin dependency versions in the lockfile; don't let CI resolve a fresh dependency tree on every run.
- Treat a new transitive dependency the same as a new direct one when it shows up in an audit — check its maintenance status and download count before accepting the fix.
- For LLM-assisted development specifically: an AI-generated dependency suggestion should be verified to actually exist and be the intended package before it's added — package-name hallucination and typosquatting are real risks when suggestions come from a model instead of a human's memory.

## Tips

- Do the five-minute threat model even when it feels like overkill for a small feature — the boundaries you skip mapping are exactly the ones that turn into incidents.
- "Handle errors" is not a security control — name the specific failure mode (a missing auth header, a malformed webhook payload) and what happens for it.
- Generic error messages to the user, detailed errors to the server log — never the reverse.

## Limitations

- This is a practices reference, not an automated scanner — it guides what to build and review for, but doesn't replace SAST/DAST tooling or a professional penetration test for anything handling real money or regulated data.
- The three-tier boundary system assumes a team that can actually enforce "ask first" — in a solo or fast-moving context, treat that tier as a personal checklist rather than a gate.
- Framework-specific examples use a Node/TypeScript stack; translate the underlying pattern (parameterize, encode, authorize, allowlist) to whatever stack the project actually uses.
