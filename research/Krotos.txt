Not just for programmers
The “Code” button in Claude Desktop isn’t just for us programmers. It’s a workspace where Claude can create files, save its work, and actually remember what you’re trying to do from one prompt to the next. It turns Claude from a brilliant but forgetful conversationalist into something closer to a real collaborator.

No scroll-hunting. No context-pasting. No starting over. These files will be available at any time- at any moment, ready to download and reuse anywhere.

Here are 20 ways to use it that have nothing to do with programming, with the exact prompts to get you started.

Here is how to Turn Claude desktop into an AI Factory!

Writing & Content
1. Article Pipeline
You have twelve half-finished drafts in different apps and no idea which version has that one good paragraph. This system keeps everything in one place: ideas, outlines, drafts, revisions. Each step builds on the last, nothing gets lost, and you can actually see your article taking shape.

Prompt 1: "Generate 15 article angles about [topic]. For each, write
a one-sentence hook and identify the target reader. Save to angles.md"

Prompt 2: "Review angles.md. Score each from 1-10 on originality,
reader value, and my ability to write it authentically. Add scores
to the file."

Prompt 3: "Take the top 3 scoring angles and create detailed outlines
for each. Include section headers, key points per section, and one
concrete example per section. Save to outlines.md"

Prompt 4: "Using outline #2 from outlines.md, draft the full article.
Keep paragraphs short. Save to draft.md"
2. Book Bible
Chapter 47: your protagonist has blue eyes. Chapter 3: they were brown. Your editor will catch this. Or Claude can catch it first, if you give it a reference file to check against. Build a living document of character details, plot points, and timeline events that Claude consults before helping you write anything.

Prompt 1: "Create a character bible template with sections for:
physical description, personality traits, speech patterns, background,
relationships, arc. Save as character-template.md"

Prompt 2: "Using the template, create character files for [names].
Save each as characters/[name].md"

Prompt 3: "Create a timeline of major events in the story so far.
Include date, event, characters involved, and consequences.
Save as timeline.md"

Prompt 4: "I'm writing a scene where [character] confronts [character].
Check their character files and the timeline. Flag any consistency
issues with what I've established, then help me draft the scene."
3. Newsletter System
Every week, same panic: what do I write about? Did I cover this already? What was my intro format again? This system stores your template, tracks what you’ve published, and drafts new issues that match your voice. The structure stays consistent even when your ideas are scattered.

Prompt 1: "Here's my newsletter format: [paste example]. Extract the
structure into a template with placeholders. Save as template.md"

Prompt 2: "Create an archive file tracking past issues: date, subject
line, main topic, open rate if known. Save as archive.md"

Prompt 3: "This week's raw material: [paste notes, links, ideas].
Using template.md and referencing archive.md for tone, draft this
week's issue. Avoid topics I've covered in the last month."
4. Social Media Content Engine
It’s 8am, you need to post something, and your mind is blank. Again. This system generates a month of content in one session, then schedules it so you’re not posting three tips in a row. The daily panic becomes a monthly batch job.

Prompt 1: "I'm a [role] who helps [audience] with [problem]. Generate
30 post concepts covering: tips, myths, questions, stories, and
contrarian takes. Save to post-ideas.md"

Prompt 2: "Go through post-ideas.md. For each concept, write the
actual post (under 280 characters for Twitter, under 2200 for
LinkedIn). Add 3-5 relevant hashtags. Save to posts-drafted.md"

Prompt 3: "Review posts-drafted.md. Flag any that sound generic or
could apply to anyone in my field. Rewrite those to be more specific
and opinionated."

Prompt 4: "Create a 30-day posting calendar. Vary the post types so
I'm not doing tips three days in a row. Save as calendar.md"
5. Video/Podcast Script Factory
You know the episode is in your head somewhere, but getting it out takes hours. This system takes a rough concept and builds it into a full script with hooks, transitions, timestamps, and B-roll notes. By the time you hit record, you know exactly what you’re saying and when.

Prompt 1: "Topic: [idea]. Generate 5 different angles I could take.
For each, describe the hook, the structure, and why a viewer would
care. Save to angles.md"

Prompt 2: "Using angle #3, create a detailed outline with: cold open
hook, main sections, transitions between sections, and a specific
call-to-action. Save to outline.md"

Prompt 3: "Expand outline.md into a full script. Include [VISUAL]
cues for b-roll moments. Mark sections that need examples I should
record myself. Target 10 minutes. Save to script.md"

Prompt 4: "Create a companion document with: timestamps for each
section, thumbnail ideas, 5 title options, and a description with
keywords. Save to production-notes.md"
Research & Analysis
6. Multi-Source Synthesis
You’ve got 14 browser tabs open, three PDFs highlighted, and notes scattered across two apps. Somewhere in there is an insight, but you can’t see it. This system lets you dump everything into one place, then asks Claude to find the patterns, contradictions, and gaps you’re missing.

Prompt 1: "I'm researching [topic]. Create a sources file with
columns: source name, key argument, evidence quality (1-5), and
notable quotes. Save as sources.md"

Prompt 2: "Here's source 1: [paste or summarize]. Add it to sources.md
with your assessment."
[Repeat for each source]

Prompt 3: "Analyze sources.md. Identify: points of agreement, points
of disagreement, gaps in the research, and which sources are most
credible. Save analysis to synthesis.md"

Prompt 4: "Based on synthesis.md, write a balanced summary of the
current state of knowledge on this topic. Note where I should dig
deeper. 800 words."
7. Decision Matrix
You’ve been going in circles for a week. Option A is better on cost, but Option B is better on quality, but Option C has that one feature you can’t stop thinking about. This system forces you to define what actually matters, weight it honestly, and let the math tell you what your gut already knows.

Prompt 1: "I'm deciding between [options] for [purpose]. Create a
decision matrix with criteria: [list what matters to you]. Weight
each criterion by importance. Save as decision.md"

Prompt 2: "Research [option 1]. Score it against each criterion in
decision.md. Add notes explaining each score."
[Repeat for each option]

Prompt 3: "Calculate weighted scores for all options. Identify which
wins overall, which wins on my top 3 criteria, and any red flags that
should override the numbers."

Prompt 4: "Play devil's advocate. What am I not seeing? What could go
wrong with the top choice? What's the case for the runner-up?"
8. Competitive Intelligence Brief
Your boss asks “what’s [competitor] doing?” and you spend three hours Googling, only to produce a vague summary. This system builds persistent profiles on each competitor that you update over time, so when the question comes, the answer is already written.

Prompt 1: "Create competitor profiles for [list competitors]. For
each: positioning, target customer, key features, pricing, strengths,
weaknesses. Save as competitors/[name].md for each"

Prompt 2: "Create a master comparison table showing all competitors
side-by-side on the key dimensions. Save as landscape.md"

Prompt 3: "Based on the competitor files, identify: market gaps
nobody's addressing, features that are table stakes, and positioning
white space. Save as opportunities.md"

Prompt 4: "Write a 1-page executive brief on our competitive position.
Where do we win? Where do we lose? What should we do about it?"
9. Interview Mastery System
The interview is in two days and you’re still answering “tell me about yourself” differently every time you practice. This system analyzes the job against your experience, generates the questions they’re likely to ask, and drafts answers that actually use your stories. You walk in knowing your talking points cold.

Prompt 1: "Here's the job description: [paste]. Here's my resume:
[paste]. Create a match analysis showing where my experience aligns
and where there are gaps. Save as match-analysis.md"

Prompt 2: "Based on match-analysis.md, generate 20 likely interview
questions. Include: behavioral, technical, situational, and 'why you'
questions. Save as questions.md"

Prompt 3: "For each question in questions.md, draft a strong answer
using the STAR method where appropriate. Pull specific examples from
my resume. Highlight where I should prepare additional stories."

Prompt 4: "Research [company]. What are they struggling with? What's
their culture like? Generate 10 questions I should ask them that show
I understand their situation."
10. Literature Review Builder
You have 30 papers to synthesize and a deadline that felt reasonable three weeks ago. This system tracks each source with its methodology, findings, and limitations, then helps you write a review organized by theme instead of just summarizing one paper after another.

Prompt 1: "I'm writing a literature review on [topic]. Create a
tracking document with: citation, year, methodology, key findings,
limitations, and how it relates to my research question. Save as
lit-review-tracker.md"

Prompt 2: "Here's paper 1: [title, abstract, key sections]. Add to
the tracker with your assessment. Note methodological strengths
and weaknesses."
[Repeat for each paper]

Prompt 3: "Analyze the tracker. Group papers by methodology, identify
trends over time, note conflicting findings, and flag gaps in the
literature. Save as lit-analysis.md"

Prompt 4: "Draft a literature review narrative organized by theme,
not by source. Show how the field has evolved and where my research
fits. Cite sources properly. Save as lit-review-draft.md"
Planning & Organization
11. Travel Command Center
Your flight confirmation is in email, the hotel is in a screenshot, the restaurant list is in Notes, and the packing list is… somewhere. This system puts everything in one workspace where your itinerary, bookings, and logistics actually talk to each other.

master planning document with sections for: flights, accommodation,
daily itinerary, restaurants, activities, packing, and documents
needed. Save as trip-master.md"

must-try dish, reservation needed, and which day of the itinerary it
fits best. Save as restaurants.md"
12. Event Production Tracker
Seventy-three people are coming, you’re not sure who’s vegetarian, and someone just asked about parking. Events have a thousand details and they all matter. This system tracks guests, vendors, timelines, and budgets in connected files so nothing falls through the cracks.

Prompt 1: "I'm planning [event type] for [number] people on [date].
Create linked tracking documents for: guest list, vendor contacts,
timeline, budget, and task list. Save each as events/[name].md"

Prompt 2: "Here's my guest list: [paste]. Add to the guest file with
columns for: RSVP status, dietary restrictions, plus-one, and any
special notes."

Prompt 3: "Based on the guest count and event type, suggest a realistic
budget breakdown by category. Flag where I'm likely underestimating.
Save to budget.md"

Prompt 4: "Create a day-of timeline starting from setup through
cleanup. Include who's responsible for each task and contingencies
for common problems. Cross-reference the vendor file for contact info."
13. Annual Life Audit
January 1st you wrote goals. January 15th you forgot them. December 31st you wonder where the year went. This system creates an honest assessment of where you are, breaks down where you want to be into actual steps, and gives you something to check against all year, not just when you’re feeling reflective.

Prompt 1: "Create a life audit template covering: career, health,
relationships, finances, learning, and fulfillment. For each area,
include: current state, wins this year, struggles, and what 'great'
would look like. Save as audit-template.md"

Prompt 2: "I'll fill in each section. [Do so]. Now analyze for
patterns. Where am I thriving? Where am I stuck? What's connected
to what?"

Prompt 3: "Based on the audit, propose 3 focus areas for next year.
For each, define: the outcome I want, why it matters, obstacles I'll
face, and first steps. Save as focus-areas.md"

Prompt 4: "Break focus-areas.md into quarterly milestones, then
monthly actions for Q1. Make the January actions specific enough
that I could start tomorrow. Save as action-plan.md"
14. Product Launch Playbook
Launch day arrives and someone asks “did anyone write the press release?” Launches have dependencies: the landing page needs the copy, the copy needs the positioning, the positioning needs the audience research. This system maps it all and makes sure nothing gets missed.

Prompt 1: "I'm launching [product] on [date]. Create a launch playbook
with sections for: positioning, assets needed, channels, timeline,

buffer for things going wrong. Save as launch-timeline.md"
Personal & Creative
15. Personal Knowledge Base
You read something brilliant six months ago. You know you saved it somewhere. You spend an hour looking and never find it. This system captures what you learn in a searchable format, so when you need that insight again, Claude can actually find it for you.

Prompt 1: "Create a note-taking template for capturing ideas with:
source, date, core insight, why it matters to me, connections to other
ideas, and questions it raises. Save as note-template.md"

Prompt 2: "Create an index file that will track all notes by topic
cluster. Start with clusters for [your main interests]. Save as

Prompt 3: "I want to add this insight: [paste]. Create a note using
the template, suggest which cluster it belongs to, and note any
connections to existing notes in the index."

Prompt 4: "I'm thinking about [topic]. Search the knowledge index
for relevant notes. Synthesize what I've captured about this topic
and identify gaps in my thinking."
16. Worldbuilding Wiki
Your fantasy novel has three magic systems that contradict each other, and your D&D players just asked a question about the kingdom’s history that you definitely made up differently last session. This system keeps your fictional world consistent by giving Claude lore files to check before it helps you create anything new.

Prompt 1: "I'm building a world for [story type]. Create a wiki
structure with categories for: geography, history, cultures, magic
system, factions, and key characters. Save as wiki-structure.md"

the magic system rules and cultural details. Flag any inconsistencies
and suggest how to fix them while keeping the scene's intent."
17. Recipe Development Lab
“I made this last month and it was perfect, what did I change?” You don’t remember. This system tracks every version of a recipe with exact measurements, what you modified, and what you learned. When you finally nail it, you can actually recreate it.

Prompt 1: "Create a master recipe template with: ingredients (with
weights), equipment needed, steps with timing, technique notes,
variations tried, and lessons learned. Save as recipe-template.md"

Prompt 2: "Here's a recipe I want to improve: [paste]. Convert it to
the template format. Note where instructions are vague and suggest
more precise alternatives."

the recipe file with version 2 and what I learned. Suggest what to
test next time."

Prompt 4: "I want to create a [cuisine] meal for [occasion]. Review
my recipe files and suggest a menu. Flag any dishes that haven't been
tested enough and might be risky for guests."
18. Reading Analysis System
You read 20 books last year and remember maybe three insights total. This system forces you to actually process what you read: capture the key arguments, connect them to other books, and identify what you should do differently. Reading becomes thinking, not just consuming.

Prompt 1: "Create a book notes template with: title, author, date read,
core thesis, key arguments, notable quotes, how it connects to other
books I've read, how it applies to my life, and questions I still have.

to fill gaps in my understanding of [topic]? Explain why."
Business & Professional
19. Proposal Factory
The RFP came in at 4pm, it’s due tomorrow, and you’re digging through old folders trying to find that one proposal that had the good case study. This system stores your best components, reusable sections, case studies, bios, pricing templates, so you can assemble a tailored proposal without starting from scratch every time.

Prompt 1: "Create a proposal template with sections for: executive
summary, understanding of their problem, our approach, deliverables,
timeline, team, investment, and next steps. Save as proposal-template.md"

objections would you raise? Where are we vague? Where do we undersell?
Rewrite weak sections."
20. Meeting Intelligence System
The meeting ended, everyone said “great discussion,” and now nobody can remember what was actually decided. This system processes your raw notes into clear decisions, action items with owners, and open questions, then drafts a follow-up email so accountability doesn’t evaporate.

Prompt 1: "Create a meeting processing template with sections for:
attendees, decisions made, action items (with owners and deadlines),
open questions, and topics deferred. Save as meeting-template.md"

Prompt 2: "Here are the raw notes from today's [meeting type]: [paste].
Process them using the template. Flag any action items that don't
have clear owners or deadlines."

Prompt 3: "Based on the processed notes, draft a follow-up email to
attendees. Lead with decisions and actions, not a recap of discussion.
Be specific about who owes what by when."

Prompt 4: "We've had 4 meetings on this project: [reference files].
Create a status document showing: what's been decided, what's still
open, what's blocked, and what each person is responsible for."
The Pattern
Every one of these follows the same structure:

Create a file with structured information
Reference that file in the next prompt
Build, analyze, or transform what’s there
Repeat until you have what you need
The files are Claude’s memory. Just like Manus uses files for it’s memory and planning.

The prompts are your instructions. You’re not just chatting anymore, you’re building something together, and it doesn’t disappear when you scroll.

Getting Started
Don’t try to learn all twenty. Pick one that solves a problem you’re actually feeling right now. Copy the first prompt. See what happens.

The “Code” button was never about code. It’s about giving your work a place to live, and giving Claude the memory to help you build it.

Start with one workflow. The rest will follow.
