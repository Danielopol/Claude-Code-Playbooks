## What This Does

Analyzes your best-performing ads to identify winning patterns (hooks, CTAs, formats), then generates variations for testing across Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, and other platforms.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Historical ad performance data
- Access to current ad copy

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your marketing folder.

### Step 2: Gather Your Data

Export your ad performance:
- Ad copy text
- CTR and conversion rates
- Spend and results

### Step 3: Analyze and Generate

Start the analysis:

```
Analyze these ads and identify winning patterns
```

## Example Usage

```
"What patterns do my best ads have?"
"Generate 20 variations of this winning hook"
"Adapt this Facebook ad for LinkedIn"
"Create Google Ads from this copy"
"Which variations should I test first?"
```

## What Gets Analyzed

- **Hooks**: What stops the scroll
- **Body copy**: What builds interest
- **CTAs**: What drives action
- **Length**: Optimal word counts by platform
- **Tone**: What resonates with your audience

## Best Practices

1. **Test hooks first** - Biggest impact on performance
2. **One variable at a time** - Know what moved the needle
3. **Platform-specific** - What works on FB may not work on LinkedIn
4. **Statistical significance** - Don't declare winners too early
