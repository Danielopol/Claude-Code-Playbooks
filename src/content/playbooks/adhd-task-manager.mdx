## What This Does

Turn overwhelming to-do lists into manageable, dopamine-friendly action plans. Tasks get broken into 15-25 minute chunks, matched to your energy levels, with ONE clear priority at any moment.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Why It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Small wins** | 15-25 min chunks = completable = dopamine |
| **Energy matching** | Hard tasks when alert, easy when tired |
| **ONE thing focus** | Reduces decision fatigue |

## Task Breakdown Example

**Before:** "Do taxes" 😰

**After:**
```
□ Gather W-2 forms (15 min)
□ Find last year's return (10 min)
□ Download bank statements (15 min)
□ Open TurboTax (10 min)
□ Enter W-2 info (20 min)
...
```

Each step = small win 🎉

## Energy Matching

| **Medium** | Meetings, routine tasks |
| **Low** | Email, filing, easy admin |

## Overwhelm Recovery

When everything feels like too much:
1. **Brain dump** - List EVERYTHING
2. **Star 3** - Pick only 3 that matter today
3. **Shrink 1** - Make the first one tiny (5 min)
4. **Start timer** - Just 5 minutes, permission to stop

---

## Tips

- **Reward yourself**: Plan small rewards after sprints
- **Parking lot**: Capture random thoughts, don't act
- **Body doubling**: Ask Claude to "work with you"
- **Flexible timing**: Adjust as energy changes

---

## Commands

```
"I'm overwhelmed, help me plan today"
"Break down [task] into tiny steps"
"What should I focus on right now?"
"I have low energy, what can I do?"
"Help me brain dump and prioritize"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Still feeling stuck**
Make the task even smaller: "What's the 2-minute version?"

**Can't focus on ONE thing**
Set a timer: "I'll focus on just this for 15 minutes"

**Energy crashed mid-day**
Pivot to low-energy tasks: "What easy wins can I do right now?"
