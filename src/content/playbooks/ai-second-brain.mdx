## What This Does

Turns your collection of notes into an intelligent knowledge base. Ask questions, find connections between ideas, and synthesize information across your notes with citations back to sources.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- A folder of notes (markdown, text, or Obsidian vault)
- Notes with reasonable structure

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your notes folder.

### Step 2: Organize Your Notes

Structure helps but isn't required:

```
notes/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── projects/
│   ├── project-alpha.md
│   └── project-beta.md
├── meetings/
│   └── 2025-01-15-standup.md
├── books/
│   └── atomic-habits.md
└── ideas/
    └── random-thoughts.md
```

### Step 3: Index Your Notes

Start Claude Code and build the index:

```
Index my notes and give me an overview of what's here
```

## Example Usage

```
"What do I know about [topic]?"
"Summarize my notes from last week"
"Connect my reading on habits with my productivity notes"
"What patterns emerge from my meeting notes?"
"Find gaps in my knowledge about [topic]"
```

## Query Types

### Direct Questions
"What's the status of Project Alpha?"
→ Synthesized answer with source citations

### Synthesis Requests
"What have I learned about effective meetings?"
→ Patterns found across multiple notes

### Connection Queries
"How does this book insight relate to that project challenge?"
→ Links ideas across different notes

### Gap Analysis
"What don't I know about [topic]?"
→ Identifies areas to research

## Best Practices

1. **Title your notes clearly** - Helps with search
2. **Add dates** - Enables temporal queries
3. **Use some structure** - Headers and bullets help
4. **Regular reviews** - Ask "what should I revisit?"
5. **Keep it current** - Index new notes as added

## Privacy Note

Your notes stay local. Claude processes them in-session only and doesn't retain information between sessions.
