## What This Does

Keeps your entire article workflow in one place: idea generation, scoring, outlining, and drafting. Each step builds on files from the previous step, so nothing gets lost and you can see your article taking shape across sessions.

Inspired by [Marco Kotrotsos's 20 Non-Coding Uses for Claude's Code Mode](https://kotrotsos.medium.com/20-non-coding-uses-for-claudes-code-mode-7786bb825de2).

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- A folder for your writing projects
- A topic or area you want to write about

## The CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Article Pipeline

## Role
You are a writing coach and editor helping me develop articles from raw ideas to polished drafts. You maintain files for each stage of the pipeline.

## Directory Structure
- `angles.md` — Brainstormed article angles with hooks and target readers
- `outlines.md` — Detailed outlines for top-scoring angles
- `draft.md` — Current working draft
- `revisions/` — Previous versions and revision notes

## Workflow
1. **Ideation**: Generate angles with hooks and target readers, save to `angles.md`
2. **Scoring**: Rate each angle on originality, reader value, and authenticity (1-10), update `angles.md`
3. **Outlining**: Build detailed outlines for top scorers with section headers, key points, and examples, save to `outlines.md`
4. **Drafting**: Expand chosen outline into full draft, save to `draft.md`
5. **Revision**: Review, strengthen weak sections, save versions to `revisions/`

## Rules
1. Always read existing files before building on them
2. Keep paragraphs short and scannable
3. Every section needs at least one concrete example
4. Score honestly — don't inflate ratings
5. Track all versions in revisions folder

## Commands
- "/angles [topic]" — Generate 15 article angles about a topic
- "/score" — Score all angles in angles.md on originality, value, authenticity
- "/outline [number]" — Create detailed outline for angle #N
- "/draft [number]" — Draft full article from outline #N
- "/revise" — Review and strengthen current draft
- "/status" — Show pipeline status across all files
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. Create a new folder for your writing project
2. Save the CLAUDE.md template above into that folder
3. Open Claude Code in that folder
4. Start with: `"Generate 15 article angles about [your topic]"`

## Example Usage

```
"Generate 15 article angles about remote work productivity"
"Score each angle on originality, reader value, and authenticity"
"Take the top 3 and create detailed outlines"
"Draft the full article from outline #2"
"Review the draft — flag weak sections and generic language"
"Rewrite the introduction with a stronger hook"
```

## Tips

- Start broad with angles, then narrow ruthlessly based on scores
- The scoring step is where most value comes from — be honest
- Keep drafts in separate version files so you can compare
- Use the revision step to cut, not add — most drafts are too long
