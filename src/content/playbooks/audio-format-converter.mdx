## What This Does

Convert audio between formats, adjust sample rates, normalize volume levels, and batch process multiple files. Claude generates the right ffmpeg commands for your needs.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Ensure ffmpeg is Installed

```bash
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Windows (with Chocolatey)
choco install ffmpeg
```

### Step 2: Create an Audio Folder

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Audio-Processing
```

### Step 3: Download the Template

Click **Download** above, then:
```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/Documents/Audio-Processing/
```

### Step 4: Run Claude Code

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Audio-Processing
claude
```

Say: **"Convert my audio files to [format]"**

## Common Tasks

### Format Conversion

| From | To | Use Case |
|------|-----|----------|
| WAV | MP3 | Reduce file size |
| MP3 | WAV | Lossless editing |
| M4A | MP3 | Compatibility |
| FLAC | MP3 | Streaming |
| OGG | MP3 | Universal playback |

### Quality Settings

| Quality | MP3 Bitrate | File Size | Best For |
|---------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Low | 128 kbps | Small | Voice/podcasts |
| Medium | 192 kbps | Medium | General music |
| High | 320 kbps | Large | Quality music |
| Lossless | N/A | Very large | Archival |

## Example Commands

### Single File Conversion
```bash
# WAV to MP3 (high quality)
ffmpeg -i input.wav -b:a 320k output.mp3

# MP3 to WAV
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 output.wav

# M4A to MP3
ffmpeg -i input.m4a -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 256k output.mp3
```

### Batch Conversion
```bash
# All WAV files to MP3
for f in *.wav; do ffmpeg -i "$f" -b:a 320k "${f%.wav}.mp3"; done

# All files in folder
find . -name "*.flac" -exec ffmpeg -i {} -b:a 320k {}.mp3 \;
```

### Audio Adjustments
```bash
# Change sample rate to 44.1kHz
ffmpeg -i input.wav -ar 44100 output.wav

# Normalize volume
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -filter:a loudnorm output.mp3

# Trim audio (start at 10s, duration 30s)
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ss 10 -t 30 output.mp3
```

## Sample Rate Guide

| Sample Rate | Use Case |
|-------------|----------|
| 8000 Hz | Telephone quality |
| 22050 Hz | AM radio quality |
| 44100 Hz | CD quality (standard) |
| 48000 Hz | DVD/video standard |
| 96000 Hz | High-resolution audio |

## Output Organization

```
Audio-Processing/
├── originals/          # Source files (untouched)
├── converted/          # Processed files
├── normalized/         # Volume-adjusted
└── _log.txt           # Processing log
```

---

## Tips

- **Keep originals**: Always preserve source files
- **Match sample rates**: Use 44.1kHz for music, 48kHz for video
- **Normalize carefully**: Loudness normalization preserves dynamics
- **Check before batch**: Test on one file first
- **Name systematically**: Include format in filename

---

## Commands

```
"Convert [file] to MP3"
"Batch convert all WAV files to MP3 at 320kbps"
"Change sample rate to 44.1kHz"
"Normalize the volume of these files"
"Extract audio from video"
"Trim this audio from [start] to [end]"
"Compress this podcast for smaller file size"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**ffmpeg not found**
Install it first (see Quick Start)

**Quality sounds bad**
Increase bitrate: "Use 320kbps instead"

**Files too large**
Ask: "Compress while maintaining decent quality"

**Batch command fails**
Check for spaces in filenames, use quotes
