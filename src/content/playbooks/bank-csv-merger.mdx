## What This Does

This playbook merges CSV exports from multiple bank accounts into a single, consistently formatted spreadsheet. Perfect for tracking all your transactions in one place or preparing data for budgeting apps.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed and configured
- CSV exports from your bank accounts
- All CSVs in one folder

## The CLAUDE.md Template

Copy this into a `CLAUDE.md` file in your bank statements folder:

```markdown
# Bank CSV Merger

## Goal
Merge all bank CSV files into one unified CSV with consistent columns.

## Output Format
Date,Description,Amount,Category,Account,Original_File

## Column Mapping Rules
- Date: Look for columns named "Date", "Transaction Date", "Posted Date"
- Description: Look for "Description", "Memo", "Transaction", "Payee"
- Amount: Look for "Amount", "Debit", "Credit" (combine debit/credit into signed amount)
- For debit/credit: debits are negative, credits are positive

## Processing Rules
1. Read all .csv files in this folder
2. Detect the bank format based on column headers
3. Map columns to the standard output format
4. Add "Account" column with the source filename
5. Add "Original_File" for reference
6. Leave "Category" blank (for manual categorization later)
7. Sort by date (oldest first)
8. Output to "merged_transactions.csv"

## Skip
- Files starting with "merged_"
- Non-CSV files
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Export your bank statements

Download CSV exports from each of your bank accounts. Most banks offer this in their transaction history.

### Step 2: Create a folder for statements

```bash
mkdir ~/Documents/BankStatements
```

Move all your CSV files into this folder.

### Step 3: Add the CLAUDE.md file

Create `CLAUDE.md` in the same folder with the template above.

### Step 4: Run the merger

```bash
cd ~/Documents/BankStatements
claude "Merge all bank CSVs according to the CLAUDE.md rules"
```

## Example

**Input files:**
- `chase_checking_jan.csv`
- `bofa_savings_jan.csv`
- `amex_credit_jan.csv`

**Output (merged_transactions.csv):**
```csv
Date,Description,Amount,Category,Account,Original_File
2026-01-02,AMAZON.COM,-45.99,,Chase Checking,chase_checking_jan.csv
2026-01-03,PAYROLL DEPOSIT,2500.00,,Chase Checking,chase_checking_jan.csv
2026-01-03,TRANSFER TO SAVINGS,-500.00,,Chase Checking,chase_checking_jan.csv
2026-01-03,TRANSFER FROM CHECKING,500.00,,BofA Savings,bofa_savings_jan.csv
2026-01-05,WHOLE FOODS,-87.32,,Amex Credit,amex_credit_jan.csv
```

## Tips & Variations

- **Add auto-categorization**: Extend the rules to automatically categorize transactions (e.g., "AMAZON" → "Shopping")
- **Monthly folders**: Create a folder structure like `2026/01/` and process by month
- **Different output formats**: Modify to output Excel (.xlsx) or for specific apps like YNAB or Mint

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Dates are in wrong format

**Solution**: Add specific date format rules to CLAUDE.md for each bank (e.g., "Chase uses MM/DD/YYYY")

**Problem**: Amounts are all positive

**Solution**: Check if your bank uses separate Debit/Credit columns and update the mapping rules.

**Problem**: Missing transactions

**Solution**: Make sure all CSV files are properly downloaded and not truncated. Some banks limit export rows.
