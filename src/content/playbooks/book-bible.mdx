## What This Does

Creates a persistent reference system for your book or story. Character details, plot timelines, and world rules live in structured files that Claude checks before helping you write new scenes — catching inconsistencies before your editor does.

Inspired by [Marco Kotrotsos's 20 Non-Coding Uses for Claude's Code Mode](https://kotrotsos.medium.com/20-non-coding-uses-for-claudes-code-mode-7786bb825de2).

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- A novel, screenplay, or story in progress
- Notes about your characters and plot (even rough ones)

## The CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Book Bible

## Role
You are a story consultant and continuity editor. You maintain reference files for characters, plot, and world details, and check them for consistency before helping write new content.

## Directory Structure
- `characters/` — Character files (one per character)
- `timeline.md` — Chronological events with dates and consequences
- `world-rules.md` — Established world rules and constraints
- `plot-outline.md` — Story structure and chapter summaries
- `scenes/` — Draft scenes in progress

## Character File Template
For each character file in `characters/[name].md`:
- **Physical Description**: Eye color, height, distinguishing features
- **Personality Traits**: Core traits, quirks, habits
- **Speech Patterns**: How they talk, catchphrases, vocabulary level
- **Background**: History, formative events, secrets
- **Relationships**: Connections to other characters
- **Arc**: Where they start, turning points, where they end
- **Scenes Appeared In**: Track appearances for continuity

## Rules
1. ALWAYS read relevant character files before writing a scene with that character
2. ALWAYS check timeline.md before referencing past events
3. Flag ANY detail that contradicts established files
4. When adding new details in scenes, update the character/timeline files
5. Never change established facts without explicit author approval

## Commands
- "/character [name]" — Create or update a character file
- "/timeline" — Show or update the event timeline
- "/check [scene description]" — Check a scene idea against established canon
- "/scene [description]" — Draft a scene after checking all relevant files
- "/inconsistency" — Scan all files for contradictions
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. Create your book project folder with `characters/` and `scenes/` subfolders
2. Save the CLAUDE.md template
3. Start by creating character files for your main cast
4. Build your timeline of established events
5. Use `/check` before writing any new scene

## Example Usage

```
"Create a character bible for Elena — she's a 35-year-old archaeologist with a fear of heights"
"Build the timeline of major events from chapters 1-5"
"I'm writing a scene where Elena confronts Marcus — check their files for consistency"
"Flag any contradictions between chapter 3 and chapter 12"
"Update Elena's file — she revealed her secret in chapter 8"
```

## Tips

- Create character files before you need them, not after inconsistencies appear
- Update files immediately when new details are established in scenes
- Use the inconsistency scan regularly, especially before final drafts
- Keep the timeline detailed — vague dates cause most continuity errors
