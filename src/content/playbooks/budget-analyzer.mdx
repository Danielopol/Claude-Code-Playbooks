## What This Does

Takes your bank statements or transaction data and creates a clear picture of your spending. Categorizes expenses, identifies patterns, spots subscription creep, and helps you build a budget based on your actual habits.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Bank statements (CSV export preferred)
- Willingness to look at your spending honestly

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your finance folder.

### Step 2: Export Your Data

Most banks let you download transactions as CSV:
1. Log into online banking
2. Find "Download" or "Export" option
3. Choose CSV format
4. Select date range (1-3 months)

### Step 3: Analyze Your Spending

Start Claude Code:

```
Analyze my spending from this bank statement
```

## Example Usage

```
"Categorize these transactions"
"Where am I overspending?"
"Show me my subscription costs"
"Compare this month to last month"
"Create a budget based on my actual spending"
"What patterns do you see in my spending?"
```

## What Gets Analyzed

- **Categories**: Housing, food, transport, entertainment, etc.
- **Patterns**: Weekly, monthly, seasonal trends
- **Subscriptions**: All recurring charges
- **Merchants**: Top spending destinations
- **Trends**: Increasing or decreasing over time

## Privacy Note

Your financial data stays local. Remove account numbers before sharing if you prefer. Claude processes in-session only and doesn't retain data.

## Best Practices

1. **Be honest** - Track everything, including cash
2. **Review monthly** - Catch issues early
3. **Set realistic goals** - Based on actual behavior
4. **Automate savings** - Pay yourself first
5. **Celebrate progress** - Small wins matter
