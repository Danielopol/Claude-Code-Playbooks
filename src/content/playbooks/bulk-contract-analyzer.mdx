## What This Does

Reviews many contracts at once to extract key provisions (termination, liability, IP), identify risks, and create a searchable database. Ideal for M&A due diligence or contract portfolio review.

## Important Disclaimer

**This is an organizational tool, not legal advice.** All findings require review by qualified legal counsel.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Contracts in text-readable format (PDF with text, DOCX)
- Understanding of what provisions matter to you

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your contracts folder.

### Step 2: Organize Your Contracts

```
contracts/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── source/
│   ├── customers/
│   ├── vendors/
│   └── employment/
└── analysis/
```

### Step 3: Start Analysis

Begin the bulk review:

```
Analyze contracts in the source folder and extract key provisions
```

## Example Usage

```
"What are the riskiest clauses across all contracts?"
"Find all change of control provisions"
"List contracts expiring in next 6 months"
"Summarize obligations across all vendors"
"Generate due diligence summary"
```

## What Gets Extracted

- Termination provisions
- Liability caps and indemnification
- IP ownership and licensing
- Payment terms
- Renewal and expiration dates
- Non-compete/exclusivity

## Best Practices

1. **Prioritize by value** - Focus on material contracts first
2. **Document gaps** - Note what's missing
3. **Flag for counsel** - Mark items needing legal review
4. **Verify critical terms** - Double-check high-risk items
