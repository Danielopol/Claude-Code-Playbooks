## What This Does

This playbook processes large collections of documents (PDFs, Word files, text files) into a synthesized report with proper citations. It converts documents to markdown, generates per-document summaries scored against a relevance matrix, then synthesizes everything into a cohesive narrative. Inspired by a Reddit user who processed 51 policy documents into a coherent 8-page vision document with footnotes — a task that would have taken weeks by hand — in 2-3 hours.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed and configured
- Documents to analyze (PDFs, DOCX, or text files)
- A clear synthesis goal or research question

## The CLAUDE.md Template

Copy this into a `CLAUDE.md` file in your document synthesis project folder:

```markdown
# Document Synthesizer

## Goal
Process a collection of documents into a synthesized report. Convert source documents to markdown, analyze each against a relevance framework, and produce a final synthesis with citations that trace every claim back to its source.

## Directory Structure
- `source/` — Original documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- `markdown/` — Converted plain-text versions of each document
- `summaries/` — Per-document summary and relevance analysis
- `framework/` — Relevance matrix and synthesis criteria
- `output/` — Final synthesized report(s)

## Processing Pipeline

### Phase 1: Convert
Convert all documents in `source/` to markdown in `markdown/`.
- Preserve structure (headings, lists, tables)
- Name files: `01-original-filename.md`, `02-original-filename.md` (numbered)
- Log any conversion issues to `output/conversion-log.md`

### Phase 2: Analyze
For each converted document, generate a summary in `summaries/`:
- 2-3 paragraph summary of key content
- Relevance score (1-5) against each criterion in the framework
- Key quotes or data points worth citing
- Cross-references to other documents covering similar topics

### Phase 3: Synthesize
Produce the final report in `output/`:
- Cohesive narrative that ties all documents together
- Organized by theme, not by source document
- Every factual claim includes a footnote citing the source document
- Executive summary at the top
- Appendix with full document list and relevance scores

## Relevance Framework Format (framework/criteria.md)
```
| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Strategic alignment | High | Does it support the stated goals? |
| Data quality | Medium | Are claims backed by evidence? |
| Recency | Medium | How current is the information? |
| Actionability | High | Does it suggest concrete next steps? |
```

## Rules
1. Every claim in the synthesis must cite a source document by number
2. Use footnotes in the format: [^1], [^2], etc. with references at the bottom
3. Do not invent information — only synthesize what's in the documents
4. Flag contradictions between documents explicitly
5. Process documents in batches of 5-10 to manage context
6. The final report should be self-contained — readable without the source docs

## Commands
- "/convert" — Run Phase 1: convert all source documents to markdown
- "/analyze" — Run Phase 2: generate summaries and relevance scores
- "/synthesize" — Run Phase 3: produce the final report
- "/status" — Show processing progress across all phases
- "/search [query]" — Search across all converted documents for a term
- "/contradictions" — List all identified contradictions between documents
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create the project structure

```bash
mkdir -p ~/doc-synthesis/{source,markdown,summaries,framework,output}
cd ~/doc-synthesis
```

### Step 2: Add your source documents

Copy all your PDFs, Word docs, or text files into the `source/` folder.

### Step 3: Define your relevance framework

Create `framework/criteria.md` tailored to your synthesis goal:

```
# Relevance Framework

## Synthesis Goal
Create a unified strategic vision from departmental policy documents.

## Criteria
| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Strategic alignment | High | Supports stated organizational goals |
| Evidence quality | Medium | Claims backed by data or case studies |
| Implementation feasibility | High | Practical and actionable recommendations |
| Stakeholder impact | Medium | Affects key stakeholder groups |
| Recency | Low | Published within last 3 years |
```

### Step 4: Save CLAUDE.md and start processing

```bash
cd ~/doc-synthesis
claude
```

Try: "/convert" to start Phase 1.

## Example Usage

**Process a collection of policy documents:**
> "/convert — Convert all 30 PDFs in the source folder to markdown. Number them sequentially and log any conversion issues."

**Analyze against your framework:**
> "/analyze — Generate a summary and relevance score for each document. Score against the criteria in framework/criteria.md."

**Produce the final synthesis:**
> "/synthesize — Write an 8-page synthesis report organized by theme. Include footnotes for every claim, an executive summary, and an appendix with the full document list."

**Search for specific topics:**
> "/search budget allocation — Show me every mention of budget allocation across all documents with context."

**Find contradictions:**
> "/contradictions — Compare documents on overlapping topics and flag any conflicting claims or recommendations."

**Export to Word:**
> "Convert the final synthesis report to a Word document with working hyperlinks in the footnotes."

## Tips

- **Batch processing**: For large collections (50+ documents), process in batches of 5-10 to avoid context limits. Claude can track where it left off.
- **Design the approach first**: The Reddit user who processed 51 documents spent most of their time designing the approach and writing prompts. The actual processing was mostly waiting and spot-checking.
- **Relevance matrix from context**: If your documents relate to a specific initiative, have Claude distill the relevance criteria from meeting minutes, mission statements, or project briefs.
- **Footnotes are essential**: The synthesis is only useful if every claim can be traced back to a source. Insist on footnotes with document numbers.
- **Iterative refinement**: Run the synthesis once, review the output, then ask Claude to improve specific sections. The first pass gives you structure; subsequent passes add polish.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: PDF conversion loses formatting or content

**Solution**: Some PDFs (especially scanned documents) may not convert well. For scanned PDFs, you may need OCR preprocessing. For well-structured PDFs, Claude can usually extract text directly.

**Problem**: The synthesis is too long or unfocused

**Solution**: Tighten your relevance framework. Add a word count target to the synthesis prompt: "Write a 3,000-word synthesis" rather than leaving it open-ended.

**Problem**: Context window is too small for all documents

**Solution**: The pipeline is designed for batch processing. The summaries act as compressed representations. In Phase 3, Claude reads the summaries (not full documents) to write the synthesis, keeping context manageable.
