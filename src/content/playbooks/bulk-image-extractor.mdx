## Extraction Methods

### From Google Docs

1. File > Download > Microsoft Word (.docx)
2. Then extract from .docx:

```bash
# Unzip the docx (it's a ZIP file)
unzip document.docx -d extracted/

# Images are in word/media/
ls extracted/word/media/
```

### From PDF

```bash
# Using pdfimages (from poppler)
pdfimages -all document.pdf output_prefix

# Using pdftoppm for full pages
pdftoppm -png document.pdf page

# Install poppler
# macOS: brew install poppler
# Ubuntu: sudo apt install poppler-utils
```

### From Word/PowerPoint

```bash
# DOCX files
unzip document.docx -d doc_extracted/
cp doc_extracted/word/media/* ./images/

# PPTX files
unzip presentation.pptx -d ppt_extracted/
cp ppt_extracted/ppt/media/* ./images/
```

### From Web Pages

```bash
# Download all images from URL
wget -r -l1 -A jpg,jpeg,png,gif -P images/ "https://example.com/page"

# Or using curl
curl -O "https://example.com/image[1-10].jpg"
```

## Batch Extraction

```bash
# All PDFs in folder
for pdf in *.pdf; do
  mkdir -p "${pdf%.pdf}_images"
  pdfimages -all "$pdf" "${pdf%.pdf}_images/img"
done

# All DOCX files
for doc in *.docx; do
  mkdir -p "${doc%.docx}_images"
  unzip -j "$doc" "word/media/*" -d "${doc%.docx}_images/"
done
```

## Image Quality

| Source | Quality | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Google Docs | High | Use .docx export, not PDF |
| Word | Original | Embedded at full resolution |
| PDF | Varies | Depends on how PDF was created |
| Web | Varies | May be compressed |

### Getting Best Quality

- **Google Docs**: Download as .docx, not PDF
- **PDFs**: Use pdfimages with -all flag
- **Web**: Look for original/full-size links
- **Presentations**: Export slides as images if needed

---

## Tips

- **Rename systematically**: Add prefixes for organization
- **Check dimensions**: Verify you got full resolution
- **Keep metadata**: Some tools preserve EXIF data
- **Deduplicate**: Remove identical images after extraction
- **Convert formats**: Standardize to PNG or JPG

---

## Commands

```
"Extract images from this Google Doc"
"Get all images from this PDF"
"Download images from [URL]"
"Extract media from this PowerPoint"
"Batch extract from all documents in folder"
"What's the best quality I can get?"
"Organize extracted images by size"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Images are low quality**
Try different export method, or source may not have better quality

**PDF extraction fails**
Install poppler: `brew install poppler` or `apt install poppler-utils`

**Can't unzip Office doc**
Rename to .zip first, then extract

**Missing images**
Some may be referenced (links) not embedded - need different approach
