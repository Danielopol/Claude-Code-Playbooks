## What This Does

Converts raw git commit history into polished, user-friendly release notes. Groups related changes, translates technical language for different audiences, and formats for various platforms.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Git repository with commits
- Access to commit history

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your project folder.

### Step 2: Run in Your Repository

Start Claude Code in your git repository:

```bash
cd your-project
claude
```

### Step 3: Generate Changelog

Ask Claude to create your changelog:

```
Generate a changelog for all commits since v1.2.0
```

## Example Usage

```
"Create release notes for commits since last week"
"Write a user-friendly changelog for v2.0"
"Summarize changes for stakeholder email"
"What features shipped this sprint?"
"Generate changelog from these commit hashes"
```

## Output Formats

### Standard Changelog

```markdown
## [1.3.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- New dashboard with real-time metrics
- Export functionality for reports

### Fixed
- Resolved timezone display issues
```

### User-Friendly Notes

```markdown
# What's New in Version 1.3

## Bug Fixes

```

## Best Practices

1. **Use conventional commits** - Makes categorization automatic
2. **Specify your audience** - Users vs developers vs stakeholders
3. **Group related changes** - Don't list 20 tiny commits
4. **Highlight breaking changes** - Always call these out
5. **Include migration notes** - When behavior changes

## Commit Type Mapping

| Commit Pattern | Changelog Category |
|----------------|-------------------|
| feat: | Added |
| fix: | Fixed |
| improve: | Changed |
| remove: | Removed |
| docs: | Documentation |
| refactor: | (Usually skip) |
