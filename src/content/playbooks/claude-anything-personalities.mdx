## What This Does

This playbook shows you how to repurpose Claude Code as a fully customizable non-coding assistant by configuring Output Styles, project-level settings, and custom commands. Each project folder becomes a different "personality" — a media server manager, a writing editor, an Obsidian notes assistant, or anything else you need. The key insight is using `keep-coding-instructions: false` to tell Claude Code to stop acting like a coding assistant and become whatever you configure it to be.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed and configured
- Basic understanding of Claude Code's project settings and `.claude/` directory

## The CLAUDE.md Template

Copy this into a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project folder:

```markdown
# [Project Name] Assistant

## Identity
You are a [role description]. You do NOT generate code unless explicitly asked. Your primary function is [primary function].

## Personality
- Tone: [professional / casual / academic / friendly]
- Style: [concise / detailed / conversational / formal]
- Expertise: [domain expertise areas]

## Capabilities
1. [Capability 1 — e.g., "Manage and organize media library files"]
2. [Capability 2 — e.g., "Research and recommend content"]
3. [Capability 3 — e.g., "Generate reports and summaries"]

## Directory Structure
- `context/` — Background knowledge files Claude should reference
- `output/` — Where Claude saves generated content
- `commands/` — Custom slash command definitions

## Rules
1. Do not generate code unless explicitly asked
2. Always save output to the `output/` directory
3. Reference files in `context/` for background knowledge
4. Use markdown for all generated content
5. When unsure, ask for clarification rather than assuming

## Knowledge Files
Read these files for context before responding:
- `context/domain-knowledge.md` — Core domain information
- `context/preferences.md` — User preferences and style guide
- `context/history.md` — Previous decisions and context

## Custom Commands
- "/summarize [topic]" — Generate a summary on the given topic
- "/research [question]" — Research and compile findings
- "/review [file]" — Review and provide feedback on a file
- "/status" — Show current project status and recent activity
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create a project folder for each personality

```bash
mkdir -p ~/media-manager/{context,output,commands}
mkdir -p ~/writing-studio/{context,output,commands}
mkdir -p ~/notes-assistant/{context,output,commands}
```

Each folder becomes a separate "personality" when you open Claude Code inside it.

### Step 2: Configure the CLAUDE.md for each project

Customize the template above for each project. For example, a **Media Server Manager**:

```
# Media Server Manager

## Identity
You are a media server management assistant. You help organize, maintain, and optimize a home media server running Plex/Jellyfin with Sonarr, Radarr, and related services.

## Capabilities
1. Check service status and health
2. Recommend content organization strategies
3. Help configure automation rules
4. Troubleshoot playback and transcoding issues
```

### Step 3: Add context files

Populate the `context/` folder with domain-specific knowledge:

```bash
# For a writing studio:
echo "# Writing Style Guide\n- Avoid passive voice\n- Keep sentences under 20 words\n- Use concrete examples" > ~/writing-studio/context/style-guide.md
```

### Step 4: Create custom commands

Create `.claude/commands/` in your project folder with markdown files for each command:

`~/writing-studio/.claude/commands/draft.md`:
```
Generate a first draft on the topic: $ARGUMENTS
Use the style guide in context/style-guide.md.
Save the output to output/draft-[topic].md.
```

### Step 5: Set up Output Styles (optional)

In Claude Code settings, you can configure per-project output styles. The key setting:

```
keep-coding-instructions: false
```

This tells Claude to drop its default coding assistant behavior and fully adopt whatever personality you've configured.

### Step 6: Launch and use

```bash
cd ~/writing-studio
claude
```

Claude now behaves as your writing assistant, not a coding tool.

## Example Personality Configurations

**Writing Editor:**
> Identity: Professional writing editor. Reviews drafts for clarity, tone, and structure. Never rewrites — only suggests edits with explanations.

**Obsidian Notes Manager:**
> Identity: Personal knowledge management assistant. Helps organize notes, suggest connections between ideas, maintain consistent tagging, and generate weekly note summaries.

**Media Server Manager:**
> Identity: Home media server admin. Can check Docker container status via SSH, recommend organization for media libraries, and help configure Sonarr/Radarr rules.

**Research Assistant:**
> Identity: Academic research assistant. Helps synthesize papers, maintain a literature review, and identify gaps in research coverage.

## Example Usage

**Switch between personalities:**
```bash
cd ~/writing-studio && claude    # Writing editor mode
cd ~/media-manager && claude     # Media server mode
cd ~/notes-assistant && claude   # Notes manager mode
```

**Use custom commands:**
> "/draft blog post about productivity systems"
> "/review output/draft-productivity.md"
> "/research latest trends in personal knowledge management"

## Tips

- **Filesystem access is the superpower**: Unlike Claude Desktop, Claude Code can read, create, and organize files across your entire project. This makes it vastly more capable for knowledge work.
- **Skills over MCPs for simple tasks**: For API calls or simple operations, Claude Code skills (context + optional scripts in a directory) use fewer tokens than MCP servers.
- **Each project is isolated**: Personalities don't leak between projects. Opening Claude Code in a different folder loads a completely different context.
- **Let Claude improve itself**: Since all configuration lives in plain `.md` files, you can ask Claude to "improve your own CLAUDE.md based on how we've been working together."
- **Commands for repetitive tasks**: If you find yourself typing the same kind of prompt repeatedly, turn it into a custom command.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Claude still acts like a coding assistant

**Solution**: Make sure your `CLAUDE.md` explicitly states "do not generate code unless explicitly asked." Also check if `keep-coding-instructions: false` is set in your output style configuration.

**Problem**: Claude doesn't reference context files

**Solution**: Explicitly list the context files in `CLAUDE.md` under a "Knowledge Files" section. Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` automatically but needs to be told which other files to consult.

**Problem**: Custom commands don't work

**Solution**: Commands must be in `.claude/commands/` (note the dot prefix on `.claude`). Each command is a `.md` file. Use `$ARGUMENTS` as the placeholder for user input.
