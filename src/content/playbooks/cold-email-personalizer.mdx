## Personalization Levels

| Level | What's Included | Example |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| **Basic** | Name, company, industry | "Hi Jane at Acme..." |
| **Good** | + Recent news, role pain point | "Congrats on the Series B..." |
| **Excellent** | + Personal detail, specific hook | "Loved your podcast on scaling..." |

---

## Research Per Prospect

For each person, Claude finds:
- Recent company news/funding
- Their LinkedIn posts or articles
- Industry trends affecting them
- Timing hooks (why reach out NOW)

---

## Example Output

```markdown
**To:** Jane Doe, VP Sales @ Acme Inc

**Subject:** Congrats on the Series B, Jane

Hi Jane,

Saw Acme's Series B news - congrats! Scaling from
$5M to $20M ARR is exactly where most sales teams
hit the "more reps ≠ more revenue" wall.

We helped [Similar Co] cut ramp time from 6 months
to 6 weeks. Happy to share what worked if useful.

Worth a 15-min chat?

[Your name]

**Hook type:** Funding trigger
**Personalization:** Level 3
```

---

## Voice Matching

Claude analyzes your emails for:
- Formality (Hey vs Hi vs Dear)
- Sentence length and rhythm
- Sign-off style
- Humor level

---

## Tips

- **Quality > quantity**: 10 great emails beat 100 generic ones
- **Specific hooks**: "Your LinkedIn post about X" > "I see you're in sales"
- **Soft CTAs**: "Worth a chat?" > "Book a demo now"
- **You still send**: Claude drafts, you review and send

---

## Commands

```
"Research and write 10 personalized emails"
"Find hooks for these 20 prospects"
"Write follow-up to [person] who didn't reply"
"Match my email voice from these examples"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Emails sound generic**
Provide more examples of your writing style

**Can't find good hooks**
Try: "Focus on their recent LinkedIn activity"

**Taking too long**
Process in smaller batches: "Do 5 prospects first"
