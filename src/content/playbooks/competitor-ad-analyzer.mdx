---

## What Gets Analyzed

| Element | What We Extract |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Ad inventory** | How many ads, formats, platforms |
| **Creative patterns** | Visual styles, video hooks |
| **Copy analysis** | Headlines, CTAs, pain points |
| **Offer structure** | Pricing, guarantees, urgency |

---

## Example Output

```markdown
## Competitor: [Name]
- Active ads: 47
- Platforms: Facebook (32), Instagram (15)
- Top format: Video (60%)

## Headline Patterns
| Pattern | Example | Frequency |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Question hook | "Tired of...?" | 35% |
| Number claim | "10,000+ customers" | 25% |

## Top Performing (Running 30+ days)
- "I was skeptical until..." (UGC video)
- "The secret that [industry] doesn't..."
```

---

## Where to Research

| Source | What You'll Find |
|--------|------------------|
| Meta Ad Library | All active Facebook/Instagram ads |
| Google Ads Transparency | Display and search ads |
| TikTok Creative Center | Trending ad formats |
| LinkedIn (manual) | B2B ad examples |

---

## Output: Swipe File

Claude creates organized swipe file:
- **Best headlines** - Proven hooks to adapt
- **Video hooks** - First 3 seconds that work
- **CTAs** - Calls to action that convert
- **Visual styles** - What's working creatively

---

## Tips

- **Long-running ads = working**: Ads live 30+ days are profitable
- **Look for patterns**: What do ALL competitors do?
- **Find gaps**: What are they NOT doing?
- **Test their winners**: Adapt (don't copy) proven concepts

---

## Commands

```
"Analyze [Competitor]'s Facebook ads"
"Compare ad strategies: [A] vs [B]"
"What headlines are working in [industry]?"
"Build me a swipe file from these competitors"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Can't find competitor ads**
They may not be running ads, or using different brand names

**Too many ads to analyze**
Focus on long-running ads: "Only show ads running 30+ days"

**Want specific format**
Filter: "Just analyze their video ads"
