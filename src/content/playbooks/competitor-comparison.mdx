## What This Does

Creates comprehensive side-by-side feature comparisons by crawling competitor sites, extracting feature lists, and organizing them into actionable matrices. Perfect for product positioning and gap analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Web access for fetching competitor pages
- Spreadsheet tool or markdown viewer for results

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your project folder.

### Step 2: Define Your Competitors

Create a `competitors.md` file listing the competitors you want to analyze:

```markdown
# Competitors to Analyze

## Direct Competitors
- competitor1.com - Main rival
- competitor2.com - Budget alternative
- competitor3.com - Enterprise focused

## Indirect Competitors
- alternative1.com - Different approach
- alternative2.com - Adjacent market
```

### Step 3: Run the Analysis

Start Claude Code and ask it to analyze your competitors:

```
Analyze the competitors listed in competitors.md and create a feature comparison matrix
```

## Example Usage

```
"Compare pricing pages across all competitors"
"What features does Competitor A have that we don't?"
"Create a matrix of integration capabilities"
"Find gaps in competitor offerings we could exploit"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Update regularly** - Competitor features change frequently
2. **Verify claims** - Marketing may not match reality
3. **Include pricing** - Often the deciding factor
4. **Note positioning** - How they describe themselves matters

## Output Example

The template generates structured matrices like:

| Feature | Us | Comp A | Comp B | Comp C |
|---------|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| SSO | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| API | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Mobile | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
