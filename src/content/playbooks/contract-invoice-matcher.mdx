## What This Does

Matches invoices to contract terms to verify accuracy. Finds underbilling (missed revenue), overbilling (errors), and tracks outstanding amounts by client.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Contract information
- Invoice records

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your finance folder.

### Step 2: Create Contract Registry

Document active contracts:

```markdown
# Active Contracts

| Client | Value | Terms | Rates |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Client A | $60K/yr | Monthly | $200/hr |
```

### Step 3: Start Matching

Verify an invoice:

```
Verify this invoice against Client A's contract
```

## Example Usage

```
"What should [client] be billed this month?"
"Find all billing discrepancies"
"Am I missing any billings?"
"Generate client billing summary"
"What's outstanding?"
```

## What Gets Checked

- Rates match contract
- Hours/units accurate
- All billable items included
- Payment terms correct
- No duplicates

## Best Practices

1. **Verify before sending** - Catch errors early
2. **Track variances** - Investigate patterns
3. **Regular reconciliation** - Monthly minimum
4. **Update contracts** - When terms change
