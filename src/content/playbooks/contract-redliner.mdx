## What This Does

Analyzes contracts against your approved templates and policies, identifies deviations, flags concerning clauses, and suggests redlines. Speeds up contract review while maintaining your standards.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Your standard contract templates
- Knowledge of your acceptable terms
- **Note**: Not a substitute for legal counsel

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your contracts folder.

### Step 2: Create Your Standards Library

Set up your reference documents:

```
contracts/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── standards/
│   ├── acceptable-terms.md
│   ├── red-flags.md
│   └── templates/
│       ├── nda-template.docx
│       └── msa-template.docx
├── incoming/
│   └── vendor-contract.docx
└── reviewed/
```

### Step 3: Define Your Risk Tolerance

Create an `acceptable-terms.md` file:

```markdown
# Acceptable Terms

## Liability
- Maximum: 12 months fees
- Unacceptable: Unlimited liability

## Indemnification
- Mutual: Acceptable
- One-sided: Flag for review

## Termination
- Minimum notice: 30 days
- Unacceptable: No termination rights
```

### Step 4: Review a Contract

Start Claude Code and analyze a contract:

```
Review the vendor contract in incoming/ against our standards
```

## Example Usage

```
"Flag all liability clauses in this contract"
"Compare this NDA to our standard template"
"What are the most concerning clauses?"
"Suggest redlines for the indemnification section"
"Create a summary for legal review"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always have legal review** - AI assists, doesn't replace lawyers
2. **Update standards regularly** - Keep your policies current
3. **Document decisions** - Why you accepted non-standard terms
4. **Track patterns** - Which vendors push back on what

## Important Disclaimer

This tool assists with preliminary contract review. All contracts should be reviewed by qualified legal counsel before signing. This is not legal advice.
