## What This Does

Generates personalized cover letters that complement your resume by telling the story behind your qualifications. Each letter is customized for the specific company and role, not generic templates.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Your resume or key achievements
- The job posting you're applying for
- Basic research on the company

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your job search folder.

### Step 2: Gather Your Materials

Have these ready:
- Job posting (full text)
- Your relevant achievements
- Why you want THIS company
- Any company research/news

### Step 3: Generate Your Letter

Start Claude Code:

```
Write a cover letter for the Marketing Manager role at Acme Corp
```

## Example Usage

```
"Make this opening more compelling"
"Add a hook about their recent product launch"
"Adjust the tone for a startup culture"
"Shorten this to 3 paragraphs"
"How should I address the career change?"
"Add more specific achievements"
```

## Cover Letter Structure

1. **Opening Hook**: Why THIS company excites you (not generic)
2. **Value Proposition**: Your most relevant achievement with metrics
3. **Cultural Fit**: How your values align with theirs
4. **Call to Action**: Request interview, thank them

## Best Practices

1. **Research the company** - Reference specific things they're doing
2. **Don't repeat your resume** - Tell the story behind it
3. **Address to a person** - Find the hiring manager's name
4. **Keep it to one page** - 3-4 paragraphs maximum
5. **Match their tone** - Startup vs. corporate language
