## What This Does

Ask questions about your spreadsheets in plain English. No formulas, no pivot tables, no VLOOKUP needed. Get summaries, insights, and visualizations just by asking.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create a Data Folder

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/DataAnalysis
```

### Step 2: Download the Template

Click **Download** above, then:
```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/Documents/DataAnalysis/
```

### Step 3: Add Your Data

Copy your CSV or Excel files into the folder.

### Step 4: Start Asking Questions

```bash
cd ~/Documents/DataAnalysis
claude
```

Then just ask: **"What were total sales last month?"**

---

## Example Questions

### Basic Analysis
- "What are the total sales in Q1?"
- "Show me the top 10 customers by revenue"
- "What's the average order value by month?"

### Comparisons
- "How do this year's sales compare to last year?"
- "Which product category grew the most?"
- "Compare performance across regions"

### Finding Patterns
- "Are there any unusual spikes or drops?"
- "What day of the week has the most orders?"
- "Is there a correlation between marketing spend and sales?"

### Leadership Summaries
- "Give me a 3-bullet executive summary"
- "What's the one thing I should tell my boss?"
- "Prepare a monthly report for leadership"

## Example Output

**You:** "What were total sales by category last month?"

**Claude:**
```
## Sales by Category - January 2025

| Category    | Revenue  | Orders | Avg Order |
|-------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Electronics | $45,200  | 234    | $193.16   |
| Home        | $28,400  | 412    | $68.93    |
| Office      | $15,800  | 156    | $101.28   |
| **Total**   | **$89,400** | **802** | **$111.47** |

💡 Electronics leads in revenue but Home has most orders.
```

## Supported Formats

| Format | Extension | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| CSV | .csv | Best supported |

## Tips

- **Start with "describe the data"**: Claude will explain columns and data types
- **Ask for methodology**: Say "show your work" to verify calculations
- **Combine files**: "Compare sales.csv with marketing.csv and show ROI"
- **Handle large files**: "Analyze the first 1000 rows and find patterns"

## Customization

### For Financial Data
```markdown
## Financial Analysis
- Always show variance from budget
- Include YoY comparisons
- Flag items over $10,000
```

### For Sales Data
```markdown
## Sales Analysis
- Track pipeline velocity
- Win/loss ratios by rep
- Lead source effectiveness
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Can't read Excel file**
Export to CSV first. Complex Excel formatting may need simplification.

**Analysis seems wrong**
Ask Claude to "show your work" and verify with a spot sample.

**File too large**
Ask for sample analysis first: "Look at the first 1000 rows"
