## What This Does

Analyze multiple customer call transcripts to identify patterns, validate product hypotheses, and generate actionable insights. Transform hours of interviews into a clear research summary.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create a Research Folder

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Customer-Research
```

### Step 2: Download the Template

Click **Download** above, then:
```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/Documents/Customer-Research/
```

### Step 3: Add Your Transcripts

Save call transcripts as individual files or one combined document.

### Step 4: Run Claude Code

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Customer-Research
claude
```

Say: **"Analyze these customer calls for patterns"**

## Example

**Input:**
```
5 customer interview transcripts about a task management app
Hypothesis: Users want better integrations with other tools
```

**Output:**

```markdown
## Research Summary: Task Management Interviews

### Hypothesis Validation
**"Users want better integrations"** - PARTIALLY VALIDATED

**Evidence:**
- 4/5 mentioned calendar integration
- 3/5 frustrated with email-to-task workflow
- Only 1/5 mentioned Slack integration

**Unexpected Finding:**
3/5 users actually want FEWER features, not more integrations

### Top Pain Points

| Pain Point | Frequency | Verbatim Quote |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Too many apps | 4/5 | "I'm drowning in tools" |
| Context switching | 3/5 | "I lose focus constantly" |
| Mobile experience | 3/5 | "It's unusable on phone" |

### Key Insight
Users don't want more integrations - they want one app
that replaces their other tools.

## Analysis Types

| Analysis | What It Answers |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Pattern Detection** | What themes appear across calls? |
| **Hypothesis Testing** | Does evidence support our assumption? |
| **Sentiment Analysis** | How do users feel about [topic]? |
| **Feature Prioritization** | What do users want most? |
| **Competitive Insights** | What do they say about alternatives? |

## Research Questions

Claude can help answer:
- What problems are users trying to solve?
- How do they currently solve this problem?
- What's their emotional response to pain points?
- What features do they actually use vs. ignore?
- What would make them switch from current solution?
- How do they describe the ideal solution?

---

## Tips

- **Include context**: User type, company size, use case
- **Note non-verbals**: Hesitation, enthusiasm, frustration
- **Quality transcripts**: Better transcripts = better insights
- **Compare segments**: Different user types may have different needs
- **Track over time**: Run analysis across research rounds

---

## Commands

```
"Analyze these calls for patterns"
"Test this hypothesis: [hypothesis]"
"What are the top pain points?"
"How do users feel about [feature]?"
"Compare responses between [segment A] and [segment B]"
"Generate a research summary for stakeholders"
"What feature requests came up most?"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Patterns seem weak**
You may need more interviews for statistical significance

**Conflicting insights**
Ask: "Segment users by [criteria] and compare"

**Missing context**
Add metadata: user type, date, interviewer notes
