## What This Does

Performs rapid digital cleanup by scanning folders, identifying safe-to-delete items (duplicates, temp files, old downloads), and making quick decisions on everything else. 7 minutes vs. 3 hours manually.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Folder to declutter
- 7 minutes of focus

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to a central location.

### Step 2: Pick Your Target

Start with high-impact areas:
- Downloads folder
- Desktop
- Photos library

### Step 3: Run 7-Minute Protocol

Start the timer:

```
7-minute cleanup of my Downloads folder, go!
```

## The 7-Minute Protocol

- **Minute 1**: Quick assessment and stats
- **Minutes 2-3**: Safe deletes (temp files, duplicates)
- **Minutes 4-5**: Quick decisions on flagged items
- **Minutes 6-7**: Organization and moves

## Example Usage

```
"What can I safely delete?"
"How much space can I recover?"
"Find duplicates in [folder]"
"Declutter my Desktop"
"Quick cleanup, go!"
```

## Safe Delete Categories

- Temp files and caches
- .DS_Store and Thumbs.db
- Exact duplicate files
- Old installers (.dmg, .exe)
- Empty folders

## Best Practices

1. **Weekly habit** - 7 minutes every Friday
2. **Start with Downloads** - Highest ROI
3. **Trust the safe list** - Temp files regenerate
4. **Be decisive** - Quick decisions, no debates
