## What Gets Analyzed

| Category | What's Checked |
|----------|----------------|
| **Apps** | Application sizes, unused apps |
| **Documents** | By type and age |
| **Media** | Photos, music, videos |
| **Developer** | node_modules, Docker, caches |
| **System** | Caches, logs, backups |
| **Hidden** | Time Machine, swap, Trash |

---

## Example Output

```markdown
## Overview
- Total: 500 GB
- Used: 420 GB (84%)
- Free: 80 GB
- Purgeable: ~45 GB

## Top Space Consumers
| Path | Size |
|------|------|
| iOS Backup (old phone) | 28 GB |
| node_modules (various) | 15 GB |
| Docker images | 12 GB |

## Cleanup Priorities
| Action | Savings | Risk |
|--------|---------|------|
| Empty Trash | 5.2 GB | None |
| Old iOS backup | 28 GB | Low |
| Clear npm cache | 8 GB | None |
```

---

## Quick Wins

These are almost always safe:
- Empty Trash
- Clear browser caches
- Remove old iOS/Android backups
- Clean package manager caches (npm, pip)

---

## Developer-Specific

| Item | Typical Size | Safe to Clear? |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| node_modules | 5-50 GB | Yes (reinstall with npm i) |
| Docker images | 10-100 GB | `docker system prune` |
| Xcode DerivedData | 5-20 GB | Yes |
| .gradle cache | 2-10 GB | Yes |

---

## Tips

- **Check old backups**: iOS backups from old phones are huge
- **node_modules adds up**: Delete from old projects
- **Docker grows silently**: Prune regularly
- **Mail attachments**: Can be gigabytes

## Commands

```
"Why is my disk full?"
"What's using space in Documents?"
"Find files over 1GB"
"How much can I free up safely?"
"Analyze my developer folders"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**"System" taking lots of space**
Often Time Machine snapshots - Claude can help identify

**Can't find the space hog**
Try: "Show hidden files and folders by size"

**Disk full but nothing obvious**
Check: Trash, Time Machine local snapshots, Mail downloads
