## What This Does

Generate creative domain name ideas for your project, brand, or business. Claude suggests names across multiple TLDs, checks availability patterns, and scores options based on memorability, length, and brandability.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create a Projects Folder

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Domain-Research
```

### Step 2: Download the Template

Click **Download** above, then:
```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/Documents/Domain-Research/
```

### Step 3: Run Claude Code

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Domain-Research
claude
```

### Step 4: Describe Your Project

Say: **"I need domain names for [describe your project/business]"**

---

## Example

**Input:**
```
I need domain names for a productivity app that helps remote teams
stay focused. Our target audience is tech startups.
```

**Output:**

| Domain | Score | Category | Notes |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| focusflow.io | 9/10 | Descriptive | Short, memorable |
| teamfocus.co | 8/10 | Descriptive | Clear meaning |
| remotepulse.com | 7/10 | Descriptive | Good for remote work |
| flox.io | 9/10 | Invented | Unique, brandable |
| deepwork.app | 8/10 | Keyword | Book reference |

---

## What You Get

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name Variations** | Compound words, portmanteaus, invented names |
| **TLD Options** | .com, .io, .co, .app, .dev, and more |
| **Scoring** | Memorability, length, pronunciation |
| **Pattern Matching** | Similar to successful brands |
| **Availability Hints** | Common patterns that tend to be available |

---

## Naming Strategies

### Compound Words
- Focus + Flow = FocusFlow
- Team + Sync = TeamSync

### Portmanteaus
- Productivity + Cloud = Prodcloud
- Remote + Velocity = Remotely

### Invented Names
- Short, pronounceable
- No existing meaning
- Easy to trademark

### Keywords + TLD
- deep.work
- remote.team
- focus.app

## Tips

- **Start broad**: Give Claude context about your industry and audience
- **Iterate**: Ask for variations on names you like
- **Check availability**: Use registrars to verify (Claude can guide you)
- **Consider trademarks**: Unique names are easier to protect
- **Test pronunciation**: Say it out loud, share with others

---

## Commands

```
"Generate 20 domain names for [project description]"
"I like [name] - give me similar variations"
"Focus on .io and .co TLDs only"
"Give me more invented/brandable names"
"What patterns do successful tech startups use?"
"Score these domains: [list]"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**All good domains are taken**
Ask: "Focus on newer TLDs like .app, .dev, .io"

**Names don't feel right**
Provide more context: industry, tone, target audience

**Need more creative options**
Ask: "Give me weird, unexpected combinations"
