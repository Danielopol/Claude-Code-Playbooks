## What This Does

Organizes and assists with due diligence review across all standard categories (corporate, contracts, IP, employment, litigation, compliance). Creates checklists, tracks findings, and generates summary reports.

## Important Disclaimer

**This assists with organization, not professional advice.** All findings require review by qualified professionals.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Access to data room or document set
- Clear transaction type (M&A, investment, etc.)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your due diligence folder.

### Step 2: Structure Your Review

Create category folders:

```
due-diligence/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── corporate/
├── contracts/
├── ip/
├── employment/
├── litigation/
└── findings/
```

### Step 3: Begin Review

Start the systematic review:

```
Set up due diligence for [acquisition/investment] of [company]
```

## Example Usage

```
"What's missing from the data room?"
"Review these corporate documents"
"Summarize key risks found"
"Create finding report for IP category"
"What are the deal issues?"
```

## Review Categories

1. Corporate & Legal
2. Contracts
3. Intellectual Property
4. Employment & Benefits
5. Litigation & Claims
6. Regulatory Compliance

## Best Practices

1. **Work systematically** - Don't skip categories
2. **Track gaps explicitly** - Missing info is a finding
3. **Prioritize by materiality** - Focus on what matters
4. **Get professional review** - AI assists, doesn't replace
