## What This Does

Find duplicate files eating your storage - exact copies, near-duplicates (same photo, different size), and version variants. Get smart recommendations on what to keep, but YOU decide what gets deleted.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Download the Template

Click **Download** above to get the `CLAUDE.md` file.

### Step 2: Place in Target Folder

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/Documents/
```

### Step 3: Run Claude Code

```bash
cd ~/Documents
claude
```

### Step 4: Scan for Duplicates

Say: **"Find duplicate files in this folder"**

---

## What Gets Detected

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Exact duplicates** | Identical content, different names | `report.pdf` and `report (1).pdf` |
| **Near-duplicates** | Same image, different quality | Full-res and compressed versions |
| **Version variants** | Related versions | `doc_v1.docx`, `doc_v2.docx`, `doc_final.docx` |

---

## Example Output

```markdown
## Exact Duplicates Found: 234 files (1.2 GB)

### Group 1: vacation-photo.jpg
| Location | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| /Photos/vacation-photo.jpg | ✅ KEEP |
| /Downloads/vacation-photo.jpg | ❌ Remove |
| /Desktop/vacation-photo (1).jpg | ❌ Remove |

Potential savings: 8.4 MB
```

## Smart Recommendations

Claude recommends keeping the file that is:
- In the most logical location (Photos > Downloads)
- Highest quality (resolution, bitrate)
- Has the most descriptive filename

---

## Tips

- **Never auto-deletes**: All deletions require your approval
- **Move to Trash first**: Recommended over permanent delete
- **Check Downloads**: Most duplicates live there
- **Large files first**: Focus on biggest space savings

---

## Commands

```
"Find duplicates in my Documents folder"
"How much space can I recover?"
"Show me duplicate photos only"
"Compare these two folders for duplicates"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Too many results**
Focus on one folder: "Just check Downloads for duplicates"

**Want to keep both**
Say: "Skip this group, I want to keep both"

**Uncertain about a file**
Claude flags uncertain cases for manual review
