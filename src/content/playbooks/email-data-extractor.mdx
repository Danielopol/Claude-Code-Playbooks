## What This Does

Analyzes email threads to extract structured data: meeting dates, deadlines, action items, decisions made, and commitments. Outputs to calendar events, task lists, and logs.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Email threads to analyze
- Target systems (calendar, task manager)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your productivity folder.

### Step 2: Prepare Email Threads

You can either:
- Paste email thread text
- Export from Gmail
- Forward to a processing folder

### Step 3: Extract Data

Process a thread:

```
Extract all dates, action items, and decisions from this email thread
```

## Example Usage

```
"What action items are in these emails?"
"Find all dates and deadlines mentioned"
"What did [person] commit to?"
"Create calendar events from this thread"
"Generate a decision log"
```

## What Gets Extracted

- **Dates**: Meetings, deadlines, follow-ups
- **Actions**: Tasks for you and others
- **Decisions**: Agreements reached
- **Commitments**: Promises made
- **Contacts**: New people mentioned

## Best Practices

1. **Process promptly** - Context fades quickly
2. **Verify dates** - Double-check important ones
3. **Track waiting-fors** - Follow up on commitments
4. **Actually add to systems** - Don't just extract, use
