## What This Does

Manages the thousand details of event planning in connected, cross-referenced files. Guest lists link to dietary needs, vendor contacts link to the day-of timeline, and budgets flag where you're underestimating.

Inspired by [Marco Kotrotsos's 20 Non-Coding Uses for Claude's Code Mode](https://kotrotsos.medium.com/20-non-coding-uses-for-claudes-code-mode-7786bb825de2).

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- An event to plan (wedding, conference, party, etc.)
- Basic details: date, guest count, type

## The CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Event Production Tracker

## Role
You help me plan and execute events with nothing falling through the cracks. You maintain connected tracking documents for guests, vendors, budget, timeline, and tasks.

## Directory Structure
- `events/guest-list.md` — RSVP status, dietary restrictions, plus-ones, notes
- `events/vendors.md` — Vendor contacts, contracts, payment status
- `events/budget.md` — Budget breakdown with actual vs. estimated
- `events/timeline.md` — Day-of timeline from setup through cleanup
- `events/tasks.md` — Task list with owners and deadlines

## Guest List Columns
| Name | RSVP | Dietary | Plus One | Table | Special Notes |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------|---------------|

## Budget Categories
- Venue, Catering, Decor, Entertainment, Photography, Rentals, Misc, Buffer (15%)

## Rules
1. Every task must have an owner and a deadline
2. Budget must include 15% buffer — flag categories where we're likely underestimating
3. Day-of timeline must include contingencies for common problems
4. Cross-reference vendor file in timeline for contact info
5. Track RSVP status actively — flag non-responders for follow-up

## Commands
- "/setup [event type] [count] [date]" — Create all tracking documents
- "/guests [list]" — Add or update guest list
- "/budget" — Suggest budget breakdown and flag underestimates
- "/timeline" — Create day-of timeline with responsibilities and contingencies
- "/status" — Overview of all tracking: RSVPs, budget, tasks, open items
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. Create an events folder
2. Save the CLAUDE.md template
3. Run `/setup` with your event details
4. Add your guest list and vendor information
5. Build the budget and day-of timeline

## Example Usage

```
"Planning a wedding for 120 people on June 15. Create all tracking docs"
"Here's my guest list — add RSVP status and dietary restriction columns"
"Suggest a realistic budget breakdown. Where am I underestimating?"
"Create a day-of timeline from 8am setup to midnight cleanup"
"Who still hasn't RSVP'd? Draft a follow-up message"
```

## Tips

- The 15% budget buffer is not optional — you'll use it
- Day-of timelines need contingencies (rain plan, late vendor, etc.)
- Cross-reference everything: the timeline should name specific vendors
- Run status checks weekly as the event approaches
