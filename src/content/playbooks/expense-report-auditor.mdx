## What This Does

Reviews expense reports against company policy, flags potential issues like missing receipts or over-limit charges, categorizes expenses accurately, and helps maintain audit-ready documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Your company's expense policy
- Expense reports to review (CSV or manual entry)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your finance folder.

### Step 2: Configure Your Policy

Create a policy file or use the defaults:

```markdown
# Expense Policy

## Meal Limits
- Breakfast: $20
- Lunch: $30
- Dinner: $50

## Approval Thresholds
- <$100: Self-approve
- $100-500: Manager
- $500+: Director
```

### Step 3: Start Reviewing

Run the auditor:

```
Review this expense report against our policy
```

## Example Usage

```
"Audit this month's expense reports"
"What documentation is missing?"
"Flag expenses over policy limits"
"Categorize these transactions"
"Generate an audit summary report"
"What approval level is needed for $750?"
```

## What Gets Checked

- **Policy compliance**: Limits, categories, approvals
- **Documentation**: Receipts, business purpose, attendees
- **Patterns**: Duplicates, split transactions, unusual timing
- **Categorization**: Correct expense types

## Best Practices

1. **Review promptly** - Catch issues while memory is fresh
2. **Be consistent** - Same rules for everyone
3. **Document exceptions** - When you approve over-limit
4. **Track patterns** - Identify training opportunities
5. **Update policy** - Keep it current and clear
