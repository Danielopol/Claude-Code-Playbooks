## What This Does

Helps non-technical founders validate ideas, define MVP scope, analyze competitors, and create investor-ready materials. Focus on strategy and planning, not code.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- A startup idea to validate
- Willingness to do customer discovery

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your startup folder.

### Step 2: Create Your Workspace

```
my-startup/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── research/
│   ├── competitors/
│   └── customers/
├── planning/
│   ├── mvp-definition.md
│   └── roadmap.md
└── pitch/
```

### Step 3: Start Validating

Begin with market validation:

```
Help me validate my idea for [product description]
```

## Example Usage

```
"Analyze the market for [my idea]"
"Who are my top 5 competitors?"
"Define my MVP - what's essential for v1?"
"Create my pitch deck outline"
"What should I test first?"
```

## What Gets Created

- **Market analysis**: TAM/SAM/SOM, trends, opportunities
- **Competitor matrix**: Who's doing what, gaps
- **MVP definition**: Must-have features vs. later
- **User stories**: What users actually need
- **Pitch materials**: Deck outline, talking points

## Best Practices

1. **Talk to customers first** - Before building anything
2. **Ruthlessly prioritize** - MVP means minimum
3. **Validate assumptions** - Test before investing
4. **Know your differentiator** - Why you, why now
