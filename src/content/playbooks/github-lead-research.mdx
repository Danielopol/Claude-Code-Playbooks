## What This Does

Find potential customers by researching GitHub repositories. Identify companies using specific technologies, frameworks, or patterns that indicate they might need your product.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create a Research Folder

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/GitHub-Research
```

### Step 2: Download the Template

Click **Download** above, then:
```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/Documents/GitHub-Research/
```

### Step 3: Define Your Search

Create `search-criteria.txt` with technologies or patterns to find.

### Step 4: Run Claude Code

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub-Research
claude
```

Say: **"Find companies using [technology/pattern]"**

---

## Example

**Input:**
```
Find companies that:
- Use Kubernetes in production
- Have large Node.js codebases
- Show signs of scaling challenges
```

**Output:**

| Company | Repos | Tech Stack | Signals | Fit Score |
|---------|-------|------------|---------|-----------|
| TechCorp | 45 | K8s, Node, TS | Recent scaling commits | 90% |
| DataFlow Inc | 32 | K8s, Go, Node | Hiring DevOps | 85% |
| CloudStart | 28 | K8s, Python | New to K8s | 80% |

---

## Search Strategies

### By Technology
Find repos using specific frameworks:
- Kubernetes configs
- Terraform modules
- Specific database drivers

### By Pattern
Find repos with certain characteristics:
- Microservices architecture
- CI/CD complexity
- Security scanning gaps

### By Activity
Analyze commit patterns:
- Active development
- Scaling indicators
- Pain point signals

---

## What Gets Extracted

| Data Point | Source | Use |
|------------|--------|-----|
| **Company Name** | Org profile | Lead identification |
| **Tech Stack** | Repo analysis | Product fit |
| **Team Size** | Contributors | Company size |
| **Activity** | Commits | Current investment |
| **Pain Points** | Issues, PRs | Sales angles |

---

## GitHub Search Queries

```
# Find Kubernetes users
language:yaml path:k8s OR path:kubernetes

# Find Node.js scaling issues
org:[company] "scaling" OR "performance" in:issues

# Find security gaps
org:[company] path:dockerfile NOT COPY --chown

# Find migration patterns
"migrating from" OR "moving to" in:readme
```

---

## Output Format

```markdown
## GitHub Research: [Technology]

### Summary
- Companies analyzed: 50
- High-fit prospects: 12
- Best leads: [top 3]

### Top Prospects

#### 1. TechCorp (90% fit)

## Tips

- **Look at issues**: Pain points are often public
- **Check commit messages**: "fixing scaling" = opportunity
- **Review dependencies**: package.json tells a story
- **Watch for migrations**: Companies switching tools need help
- **Note team growth**: New contributors = growing company

---

## Commands

```
"Find companies using [technology]"
"Analyze [org name] repositories"
"What pain points does [company] have?"
"Find companies migrating from [tech A] to [tech B]"
"Export leads to CSV"
"Who are the decision makers at [company]?"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Not enough public repos**
Try: "Look at dependencies and contributor profiles"

**Can't identify company**
Ask: "Find company info from contributor emails"

**Need more context**
Ask: "Analyze issues and discussions for [company]"
