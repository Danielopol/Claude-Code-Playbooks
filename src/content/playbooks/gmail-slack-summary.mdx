## What This Does

Takes important emails from Gmail, summarizes them, extracts action items, assigns priority, and posts to appropriate Slack channels. Keeps you informed without drowning in email.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Gmail account
- Slack workspace
- Integration tool (Zapier, Make, or native)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your workflow folder.

### Step 2: Define Priority Rules

Create priority classifications:

```markdown
# Email Priority Rules

## P1 - Immediate
From: [VIP senders]
Contains: URGENT, deadline today

## P2 - High
From: [Team, key vendors]
Contains: Action required

## P3 - Normal
Standard business emails
```

### Step 3: Configure Channels

Set up Slack channels:

```
#email-urgent - P1 only
#email-team - P2 and P3
#email-digest - Daily summary
```

## Example Usage

```
"Summarize this email for Slack"
"What priority should this be?"
"Create a daily digest"
"Add [sender] to VIP list"
"Skip all emails from [source]"
```

## Summary Format

Each email summary includes:
- Priority badge
- Sender and subject
- 2-3 sentence summary
- Action items extracted
- Link to full email

## Best Practices

1. **Start with P1 only** - Avoid notification fatigue
2. **Tune over time** - Adjust rules based on experience
3. **Keep summaries short** - Respect readers' time
4. **Include daily digest** - Catch what you missed
