## What This Does

Converts your descriptions of how you want your smart home to behave ("turn on lights when I get home") into actual automation configurations for Home Assistant, HomeKit, or SmartThings.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Smart home platform (Home Assistant, HomeKit, etc.)
- Basic understanding of your devices

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your home automation folder.

### Step 2: List Your Devices

Create a device inventory:

```markdown
# My Smart Home

## Lights
- Living room lights (Hue)
- Bedroom lights (Hue)

## Sensors
- Front door motion sensor
- Hallway motion sensor

## Other
- Thermostat (Nest)
- Door locks (August)
```

### Step 3: Create Automations

Describe what you want:

```
Create an automation to turn on hallway lights when motion is detected at night
```

## Example Usage

```
"Turn everything off when everyone leaves"
"Cozy mode at sunset"
"Wake up routine at 7am weekdays"
"Alert me if door opens when I'm away"
"Translate this to Home Assistant YAML"
```

## Supported Platforms

- Home Assistant (YAML)
- Apple HomeKit (Shortcuts)
- SmartThings
- Google Home (routines)

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple** - One automation at a time
2. **Test thoroughly** - Verify triggers work
3. **Add delays** - Prevent rapid toggling
4. **Document** - Note what each automation does
