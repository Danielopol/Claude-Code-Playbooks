## What This Does

Helps homeowners maintain their property by tracking seasonal maintenance tasks, appliance service history, contractor information, and home improvement projects.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- A folder for home maintenance records
- List of your major home systems and appliances

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your home folder.

### Step 2: Create Your Home Profile

Document your home's systems:

```markdown
# Home Systems Registry

## HVAC
- Furnace: [Brand/Model], installed [Year]
- AC Unit: [Brand/Model], installed [Year]

## Water Heater
- Type: [Tank/Tankless]
- Brand: [Name], installed [Year]

## Appliances
[List major appliances with purchase dates]
```

### Step 3: Start Tracking

Initialize your maintenance schedule:

```
Set up home maintenance tracking for my 3-bedroom house
```

## Example Usage

```
"What maintenance is due this month?"
"Log: replaced HVAC filter today"
"Generate my spring maintenance checklist"
"When was the furnace last serviced?"
"Add contractor: Joe's Plumbing, 555-1234"
```

## Maintenance Categories

- **Monthly**: Filters, detectors, basic checks
- **Quarterly**: Safety systems, cleaning tasks

## Best Practices
