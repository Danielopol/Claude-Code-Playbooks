## What This Does

Helps manage the complexity of immigration applications by tracking required documents, deadlines, case status, and RFE (Request for Evidence) responses. Keeps everything organized throughout lengthy visa processes.

## Important Disclaimer

**This is an organizational tool, not legal advice.** For immigration decisions, consult a qualified immigration attorney. Laws and procedures change frequently.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- A folder for your immigration case files
- Your case receipt numbers and key dates

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your case folder.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Case Structure

```
immigration-case/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── documents/
│   ├── primary/
│   └── supporting/
├── correspondence/
│   └── uscis-notices/
└── timeline.md
```

### Step 3: Initialize Your Case

Start Claude Code and set up tracking:

```
Set up tracking for my I-485 adjustment of status application
```

## Example Usage

```
"What documents am I missing for my I-485?"
"When is my next deadline?"
"Update: received biometrics appointment"
"Prepare checklist for RFE response"
"What's my current case timeline?"
```

## What Gets Tracked

- Required documents by visa type
- Document expiration dates
- Case milestones and status changes
- Processing time estimates
- RFE response deadlines
- Upcoming appointments

## Best Practices

1. **Keep copies of everything** - Never send originals
2. **Track every submission** - Date, contents, tracking number
3. **Monitor processing times** - Check USCIS.gov regularly
4. **Respond to RFEs promptly** - Don't wait until deadline
5. **Consult an attorney** - For complex situations
