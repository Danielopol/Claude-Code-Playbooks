## What This Does

Tackle 500+ unread emails without the overwhelm. Claude categorizes, prioritizes, drafts responses in your voice, and identifies bulk actions - but NEVER sends without your approval.

---

## Quick Start

Click **Download** above to get the `CLAUDE.md` file.

### Step 2: Export Your Emails

Export from Gmail/Outlook or describe your inbox situation.

### Step 3: Run Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

### Step 4: Start Processing

Say: **"Help me process my inbox (500 unread emails)"**

## How It Works

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1. Categorize | Sort into Action/Reference/Delete |
| 2. Prioritize | Urgent/This Week/Can Wait |
| 3. Draft | Write responses in your voice |
| 4. Review | You approve everything |
| 5. Execute | You send (Claude never auto-sends) |

---

## Categories

| Category | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Urgent** | Respond today |
| **This Week** | Respond within 7 days |
| **Reference** | Archive for later |
| **Unsubscribe** | Remove from list |
| **Delete** | Safe to remove |

---

## Example Output

```markdown
## Summary: 547 emails processed
- Urgent: 8 (drafts ready)
- This Week: 37
- Archive: 312
- Unsubscribe: 85
- Delete: 105

## Urgent - Respond Today
| From | Subject | Draft Ready |
|------|---------|-------------|
| boss@work.com | Q1 Budget | ✓ |
| client@co.com | Contract Q | ✓ |

## Quick Wins
- 85 newsletters → Bulk unsubscribe
- 105 promotions → Bulk delete
```

---

## Response Drafting

Claude matches your voice by analyzing your sent emails:
- Greeting style (Hey vs Hi vs Dear)
- Sign-off preference
- Formality level
- Typical length

---

## Tips

- **Start with bulk actions**: Unsubscribe/delete first
- **Review urgent drafts**: These need your attention
- **Process weekly**: Prevent backlog buildup
- **Voice training**: Share 5-10 sent emails for better drafts

---

## Commands

```
"Process my inbox"
"Draft responses to urgent emails"
"What can I bulk delete?"
"Unsubscribe me from newsletters I never read"
"Prioritize emails from [person]"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Drafts don't sound like me**
Share more example emails: "Here's how I usually write..."

**Missing important emails**
Say: "Always prioritize emails from [domain/person]"

**Too many categories**
Simplify: "Just sort into Respond/Archive/Delete"
