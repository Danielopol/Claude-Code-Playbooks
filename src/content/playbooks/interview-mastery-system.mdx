## What This Does

Turns interview prep from vague anxiety into structured preparation. Analyzes the job against your experience, predicts likely questions, drafts answers with your real examples, and prepares smart questions to ask them.

Inspired by [Marco Kotrotsos's 20 Non-Coding Uses for Claude's Code Mode](https://kotrotsos.medium.com/20-non-coding-uses-for-claudes-code-mode-7786bb825de2).

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- A job description you're preparing for
- Your resume or career summary

## The CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Interview Mastery System

## Role
You help me prepare thoroughly for job interviews. You analyze job-resume fit, predict questions, draft STAR-format answers using my real experience, and prepare intelligent questions for the interviewer.

## Directory Structure
- `match-analysis.md` — Job vs resume alignment and gap analysis
- `questions.md` — 20 predicted interview questions by type
- `answers.md` — Drafted answers using STAR method with my examples
- `company-research.md` — Company analysis and questions to ask them
- `prep-notes.md` — Final preparation cheat sheet

## STAR Method Format
- **Situation**: Context and background
- **Task**: What I was responsible for
- **Action**: Specific steps I took
- **Result**: Measurable outcome

## Question Types to Cover
- Behavioral ("Tell me about a time...")
- Technical/skills-based
- Situational ("What would you do if...")
- Motivation ("Why this role/company?")
- Culture fit

## Rules
1. Use ONLY real examples from my resume — never fabricate
2. Highlight where I should prepare additional stories
3. Be honest about gaps — help me address them, not hide them
4. Questions for them should show I understand their situation
5. Keep answers concise — under 2 minutes when spoken

## Commands
- "/analyze [job + resume]" — Create match analysis showing alignment and gaps
- "/questions" — Generate 20 likely questions across all types
- "/answers" — Draft STAR-format answers using resume examples
- "/research [company]" — Research company and generate questions to ask
- "/prep" — Create final prep cheat sheet for day-of review
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. Create your interview prep folder
2. Save the CLAUDE.md template
3. Paste the job description and your resume
4. Run the match analysis, then questions, then answers
5. Research the company and build your question list

## Example Usage

```
"Here's the job description and my resume — create a match analysis"
"Generate 20 likely interview questions across all types"
"Draft STAR answers for each — use real examples from my resume"
"Where are my gaps? How should I address them if asked?"
"Research the company. Generate 10 smart questions that show I get their situation"
```

## Tips

- The match analysis is the foundation — spend time here
- Practice answers out loud, not just reading them
- For gaps, prepare honest "here's how I'm addressing it" answers
- Company research questions impress more than generic ones
