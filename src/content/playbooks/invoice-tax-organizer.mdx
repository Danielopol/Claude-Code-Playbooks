## What This Does

Transform a messy folder of tax documents into a perfectly organized archive. Claude reads each file, extracts date and vendor, renames it consistently, and sorts it into the right folder.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create a Tax Folder

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Tax-2025
```

### Step 2: Download the Template

Click **Download** above, then move to your tax folder:
```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/Documents/Tax-2025/
```

### Step 3: Add Your Documents

Drop all your tax documents (PDFs, images, scans) into the folder.

### Step 4: Run Claude Code

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Tax-2025
claude
```

Then say: **"Organize all my tax documents"**

## Naming Convention

All files get renamed to: `YYYY-MM-DD_Vendor_Type_Description.ext`

## Tax Season Workflow

### Quarterly Cleanup
```
"Organize any new documents added since last time"
```

### Pre-Filing Checklist
```
"Check my documents against a standard tax checklist. What am I missing?"
```

### Year-End Summary
```
"Create a summary of all documents organized by category with totals"
```

## Tips

- **Never deletes files**: Claude only renames and moves
- **Handles photos**: Can read receipt images and scanned documents
- **Multi-year support**: Automatically detects and separates tax years
- **Tracks totals**: Can generate expense summaries with amounts

---

## Troubleshooting

**Wrong date extracted**
Say: "The date for [filename] should be [correct date]"

**Can't read scanned PDF**
Ensure the PDF has OCR text. If it's just an image, Claude can still often read it.

**Documents from different year**
Claude flags these automatically. Say: "Move all 2024 docs to Tax-2024/"
