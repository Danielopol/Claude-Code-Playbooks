## Tips

- **Be specific**: Vague descriptions attract wrong candidates
- **Show don't tell**: Describe work, not just requirements
- **Include salary**: Transparency attracts better candidates
- **List must-haves only**: Long lists discourage good people
- **Highlight growth**: Top candidates want to learn

---

## Commands

```
"Create a job description for [role]"
"Write an interview rubric for [position]"
"Design a hiring process for [role]"
"What screening questions should I ask?"
"Create a take-home project for [role]"
"Benchmark salary for [role] in [location]"
"How should I structure the interview?"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Description too generic**
Add more context: company stage, team size, specific projects

**Requirements too long**
Ask: "Separate must-haves from nice-to-haves"

**Not attracting right candidates**
Ask: "Make this more compelling for [target candidate type]"
