## What This Does

Helps with B2B prospecting by identifying ideal customers, researching decision-makers, finding personalization hooks (news, posts, connections), and drafting LinkedIn messages that get responses.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Defined ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
- LinkedIn account

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your sales folder.

### Step 2: Define Your ICP

Create an ICP document:

```markdown
# My Ideal Customer

- Industry: [sectors]
- Company size: [range]
- Title: [decision makers]
- Pain points: [what they struggle with]
```

### Step 3: Start Researching

Begin prospecting:

```
Research [company name] as a potential prospect
```

## Example Usage

```
"Find decision makers at [company]"
"What personalization hooks can I use for [person]?"
"Draft a connection request for [context]"
"Create a 3-touch follow-up sequence"
"Review my outreach message"
```

## Outreach Elements

- **Company research**: News, funding, tech stack
- **Contact research**: Background, interests, activity
- **Personalization hooks**: Shared connections, content, experiences
- **Message templates**: Connection requests, follow-ups

## Best Practices

1. **Personalize every message** - Generic = ignored
2. **Lead with value** - Not a pitch
3. **Engage first** - Comment on their content
4. **Be patient** - Relationships take time
