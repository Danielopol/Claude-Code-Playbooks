## What This Does

Creates your personal Yelp-style database of local businesses. Never forget that amazing restaurant, avoid places you didn't like, and quickly find recommendations when friends ask "where should we eat?"

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- A folder for your reviews database
- Places you've visited to review

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your reviews folder.

### Step 2: Create Your Review Structure

```
local-reviews/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── restaurants/
├── services/
├── shopping/
└── favorites.md
```

### Step 3: Start Reviewing

Add your first business:

```
Add restaurant: Blue Hen Vietnamese, 5 stars, best pho in town
```

## Example Usage

```
"What's my best Italian restaurant?"
"Rate Joe's Auto Shop 4 stars - good service but slow"
"Show all 5-star restaurants"
"What did I think of that Thai place downtown?"
"Find coffee shops good for working"
"Add to avoid list: Quick Lube on Main St"
```

## Review Categories

- **Restaurants & Cafes**
- **Services** (auto, hair, home repair)
- **Shopping** (grocery, specialty)
- **Health** (doctors, dentists, gyms)
- **Entertainment** (venues, activities)

## Best Practices

1. **Review while fresh** - Add notes right after visiting
2. **Be specific** - What to order, when to go
3. **Note context** - Good for dates vs. family vs. solo
4. **Track patterns** - Notice what you consistently like
5. **Update over time** - Places change
