## What This Does

Helps diagnose Mac performance issues by running appropriate diagnostic commands, explaining results in plain English, and providing clear steps to resolve problems.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Mac computer with performance issues
- Admin access (for some diagnostics)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it anywhere accessible.

### Step 2: Describe Your Issue

Common starting points:
- "My Mac is running slow"
- "Fan is always running"
- "Running out of disk space"
- "Apps keep crashing"

### Step 3: Run Diagnostics

Start with a health check:

```
Run a quick health check on my Mac
```

## Example Usage

```
"Why is my Mac slow?"
"What's using all my disk space?"
"Diagnose this overheating issue"
"Check my memory usage"
"Help me free up space"
```

## Common Diagnostics

- **Disk space**: What's consuming storage
- **Memory**: What's using RAM
- **CPU**: What's hogging processor
- **Battery**: Health and cycle count
- **Startup items**: What's loading on boot

## Best Practices

1. **Regular checkups** - Monthly health check
2. **Restart occasionally** - Clears memory
3. **Keep space free** - 10-15% minimum
4. **Update macOS** - Security and performance
