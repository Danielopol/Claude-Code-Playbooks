## Example

**Input (transcript excerpt):**
```
Sarah: So about the deadline...
John: Yeah, I think... maybe we could... I mean, it's probably fine.
Maria: [silence]
Sarah: Great, so we're all good then?
John: Sure, I guess.
```

**Output:**

| Pattern | Speaker | Quote | Concern Level |
|---------|---------|-------|---------------|
| Hedging | John | "maybe we could... I mean" | Medium |
| Silence | Maria | [no response to deadline] | High |
| Premature closure | Sarah | "so we're all good then?" | Medium |
| Passive agreement | John | "Sure, I guess" | High |

**Can't identify speakers**
Format as "[Name]: [speech]" for better analysis

**Results seem off**
Provide context: "This was a tense project review meeting"
