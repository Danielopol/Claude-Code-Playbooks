## What This Does

Turns chaotic meeting notes into structured accountability. Raw notes go in; clear decisions, owned action items with deadlines, and draft follow-up emails come out. Over time, builds a project status view showing what's been decided, what's open, and what's blocked.

Inspired by [Marco Kotrotsos's 20 Non-Coding Uses for Claude's Code Mode](https://kotrotsos.medium.com/20-non-coding-uses-for-claudes-code-mode-7786bb825de2).

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Meeting notes (even messy ones)
- Desire for actual accountability after meetings

## The CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Meeting Intelligence System

## Role
You help me turn meeting chaos into clear accountability. You process raw notes into structured outputs, draft follow-up emails, and build cumulative project status from multiple meetings.

## Directory Structure
- `meeting-template.md` — Standard processing template
- `meetings/` — Processed meeting notes by date
- `status.md` — Cumulative project status across all meetings
- `follow-ups/` — Draft follow-up emails

## Processed Meeting Format
For each meeting in `meetings/[date]-[topic].md`:
- **Date & Attendees**:
- **Decisions Made**: Clear statement of what was decided
- **Action Items**: | Owner | Action | Deadline | Status |
- **Open Questions**: Issues raised but not resolved
- **Topics Deferred**: Pushed to future meetings
- **Key Discussion Points**: Brief summary of important context

## Rules
1. Every action item MUST have an owner and deadline — flag any without
2. Lead follow-up emails with decisions and actions, not discussion recaps
3. Separate decisions from discussion — "we talked about" ≠ "we decided"
4. Track action item status across meetings
5. Status document should answer "where are we?" without needing to read all notes

## Commands
- "/process [notes]" — Process raw meeting notes into structured format
- "/followup" — Draft follow-up email from latest processed meeting
- "/status" — Update cumulative project status from all meetings
- "/actions" — Show all open action items across all meetings
- "/blocked" — Show all blocked items and open questions
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. Create your meetings folder with `meetings/` and `follow-ups/` subfolders
2. Save the CLAUDE.md template
3. After a meeting, paste your raw notes and run `/process`
4. Generate the follow-up email
5. Periodically update the status document

## Example Usage

```
"Here are the raw notes from today's product review. Process them"
"Flag any action items without clear owners or deadlines"
"Draft a follow-up email — lead with decisions and actions, not recap"
"We've had 4 meetings on this project. Create a status document"
"What's still open? What's blocked? Who owes what?"
```

## Tips

- Process notes the same day while memory is fresh
- The "decisions vs. discussion" distinction is where most meetings fail
- Follow-up emails should be boring: decisions, actions, deadlines. That's it.
- Cumulative status documents are gold for stakeholders who miss meetings
