## What This Does

Transform raw meeting transcripts (from Otter, Granola, Zoom, or any tool) into structured notes with action items, decisions, and follow-ups - all assigned to the right people.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create a Meetings Folder

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Meetings
```

### Step 2: Download the Template

Click **Download** above, then:
```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/Documents/Meetings/
```

### Step 3: Add a Transcript

Either save your transcript as `transcript.txt` or paste it directly.

### Step 4: Run Claude Code

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Meetings
claude
```

Then: **"Process the meeting transcript"** or paste the transcript directly.

## Example

**Input (raw transcript):**
```
[00:00] Sarah: Let's get started. John, how's the Q1 report?
[00:15] John: Almost done. I'll have it by Friday.
[00:22] Sarah: Great. Maria, the client presentation?
[00:30] Maria: I need the updated figures from John first.
[00:35] John: I'll send those over today.
[00:50] Sarah: We decided to go with Option B for pricing.
```

**Output (structured note):**

| Owner | Task | Due | Priority |
|-------|------|-----|----------|
| @John | Complete Q1 report | Friday | High |
| @John | Send figures to Maria | Today | High |
| @Maria | Schedule dry run meeting | Monday | Med |

**Key Decision:** Go with Option B for pricing

## What Gets Extracted

| Pattern | Example | Result |
|---------|---------|--------|
| "I'll do X" | "I'll send the report" | Action for speaker |
| "[Name] will X" | "John will review" | Action for John |
| "We decided to..." | "We decided to go with A" | Decision logged |
| "Let's X by [date]" | "Let's meet by Friday" | Action with deadline |
| "TODO:" | "TODO: update docs" | Explicit action item |

## Integrations

### For Obsidian Users
Add to CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
- Save to: ~/Obsidian/Meetings/
- Add [[backlinks]] to attendee notes
- Tag with #meeting
```

### For Notion Users

```

### Auto-Email Follow-ups
```markdown
Draft brief follow-up emails (2-3 sentences) to each person with their action items
```

## Tips

- **Every action needs an owner**: Claude flags items with "ASSIGN:" if unclear
- **Handles any format**: Timestamped, speaker labels, or plain text
- **Priority assignment**: High = blocking/urgent, Medium = important, Low = nice-to-have
- **Works with any transcript tool**: Otter, Zoom, Google Meet, manual notes

---

## Troubleshooting

**Speaker names not detected**
Tell Claude: "Speakers are formatted as '[Name]:' at the start of each line"

**Too many action items**
Add: "Only extract explicit commitments, not suggestions"

**Missing context for decisions**
Ask: "Add more context around why we decided [X]"
