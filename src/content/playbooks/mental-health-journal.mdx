```

### Step 3: Start Journaling

Begin a session:

```

```

## Example Usage

```
"I need to process something difficult"
"What patterns do you see in my entries?"
"Give me a prompt for feeling overwhelmed"
"Help me reframe this negative thought"
"What were my wins this week?"
```

## Daily Entry Template

The assistant can help you fill out:

- How you're feeling (energy, mood, emotions)
- What happened today
- What went well (3 things)
- What was challenging
- What you're grateful for
- Self-care check (sleep, exercise, connection)

## What the Assistant Does

- Listens without judgment
- Asks thoughtful follow-up questions
- Helps you explore your thoughts
- Notices patterns over time
- Celebrates your wins
- Reminds you of past insights

## What It Won't Do

- Diagnose conditions
- Prescribe treatments
- Replace professional help
- Tell you how to feel
- Minimize your experiences

## Best Practices

1. **Be honest** - No judgment here
2. **Regular entries** - Patterns emerge over time
3. **Review weekly** - Look back and reflect
4. **Note what helps** - Track coping strategies
5. **Seek help when needed** - This supplements, doesn't replace, professional support
