Consolidates transactions from multiple credit cards and bank accounts into one view. Categorizes expenses, matches receipts, identifies patterns, and generates reports for reimbursement or taxes.

## Prerequisites

- Receipt images (optional)

## Setup Instructions

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your finance folder.

### Step 2: Export Your Statements

From each card/bank:
1. Log into online banking
2. Export transactions as CSV
3. Save to your tracking folder

### Step 3: Import and Analyze

Start the analysis:

```
Import these transactions and categorize my spending
```

## Example Usage

```
"Categorize my January expenses"
"Which transactions need receipts?"
"Generate expense report for work trip"
"Compare spending to last month"
"Export business expenses for taxes"
```

## What Gets Tracked

- All transactions across accounts
- Auto-categorization by merchant
- Receipt matching status
- Business vs. personal split
- Monthly comparisons

1. **Import weekly** - Don't let it pile up
2. **Categorize immediately** - While you remember
3. **Snap receipts** - Use phone camera
4. **Note business purpose** - For deductions
