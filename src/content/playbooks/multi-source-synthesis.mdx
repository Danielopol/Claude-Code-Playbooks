## What This Does

Replaces the chaos of 14 browser tabs and scattered highlights. Consolidate sources into a structured file, then Claude identifies agreements, contradictions, credibility gaps, and areas needing more research.

Inspired by [Marco Kotrotsos's 20 Non-Coding Uses for Claude's Code Mode](https://kotrotsos.medium.com/20-non-coding-uses-for-claudes-code-mode-7786bb825de2).

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Multiple sources on a research topic (articles, papers, notes)
- A specific research question or topic

## The CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Multi-Source Research Synthesis

## Role
You help me synthesize research across multiple sources. You maintain a structured source database, analyze for patterns and contradictions, and produce balanced summaries that identify where I need to dig deeper.

## Directory Structure
- `sources.md` — Master source table: name, key argument, evidence quality, quotes
- `synthesis.md` — Cross-source analysis: agreements, disagreements, gaps
- `summary.md` — Balanced summary of current knowledge
- `raw/` — Raw source material and notes

## Source Assessment Criteria
- Evidence quality (1-5): methodology rigor, sample size, replicability
- Argument strength (1-5): logic, support, counterargument handling
- Relevance (1-5): direct connection to research question
- Recency: how current the information is

## Rules
1. Assess every source on the criteria above — no exceptions
2. Note direct quotes with page/section references
3. Identify when sources contradict each other explicitly
4. The synthesis must address gaps, not just findings
5. Summaries should note confidence levels for each claim

## Commands
- "/add [source]" — Add a new source to sources.md with assessment
- "/analyze" — Cross-analyze all sources for patterns, contradictions, gaps
- "/summarize" — Write balanced summary with confidence levels
- "/gaps" — Identify what's missing and suggest where to look
- "/status" — Show how many sources added and coverage assessment
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. Create your research folder
2. Save the CLAUDE.md template
3. Add your first source with `/add`
4. Continue adding sources one at a time
5. Run `/analyze` once you have 3+ sources

## Example Usage

```
"I'm researching the impact of remote work on productivity. Create the sources file"
"Here's source 1: [paste article]. Add it with your assessment"
"Analyze all sources — where do they agree and disagree?"
"Which sources are most credible and why?"
"Write a balanced 800-word summary noting where I should dig deeper"
```

## Tips

- Quality of source assessment matters more than quantity of sources
- Add sources one at a time for thorough assessment
- Run the gap analysis before concluding research — it often reveals blind spots
- Include sources you disagree with for balance
