## What This Does

Accelerates the MVP planning process from weeks to days. Covers competitive research, feature prioritization (ICE scoring), user story creation, sprint planning, and launch preparation.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Product concept defined
- Basic understanding of your target users

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your project folder.

### Step 2: Prepare for Your Sprint

Have these ready:
- Product concept one-pager
- Any existing user research
- Technical constraints (if known)

### Step 3: Run Your Planning Sprint

Start the 3-day accelerated planning:

```
Start my MVP planning sprint for [product name]
```

## Sprint Structure

- **Day 1**: Research & Discovery (8 hours)
- **Day 2**: Definition & Prioritization (8 hours)
- **Day 3**: Planning & Launch Prep (8 hours)

## Example Usage

```
"Prioritize these features using ICE scoring"
"Write user stories for the core features"
"Create a sprint plan for launch"
"What should we cut from MVP?"
"Build my launch checklist"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Timebox ruthlessly** - Don't debate, decide
2. **Document everything** - Capture decisions as you go
3. **Focus on learning** - MVP is to learn, not impress
4. **Ship something** - Perfect is the enemy of shipped
