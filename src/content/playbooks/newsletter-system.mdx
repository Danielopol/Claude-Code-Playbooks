## What This Does

Eliminates the weekly newsletter panic. Your format template, past issue archive, and voice guide live as files that Claude references when drafting — ensuring consistent tone and no repeated topics.

Inspired by [Marco Kotrotsos's 20 Non-Coding Uses for Claude's Code Mode](https://kotrotsos.medium.com/20-non-coding-uses-for-claudes-code-mode-7786bb825de2).

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- An example of a past newsletter issue (for voice extraction)
- Raw notes or ideas for upcoming issues

## The CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Newsletter System

## Role
You help me write consistent, high-quality newsletters. You maintain my template, track past issues, and draft new ones matching my established voice and format.

## Directory Structure
- `template.md` — Newsletter structure with placeholders
- `archive.md` — Past issues: date, subject, topic, open rate
- `voice-guide.md` — Extracted tone, style, and formatting patterns
- `drafts/` — Current and past drafts
- `raw-material/` — Notes, links, and ideas for upcoming issues

## Rules
1. Always check `archive.md` before drafting — avoid topics covered in the last month
2. Follow `template.md` structure exactly for every issue
3. Match the tone and style documented in `voice-guide.md`
4. Keep subject lines under 50 characters
5. Every issue needs a clear takeaway for the reader

## Commands
- "/template [example]" — Extract structure from a past issue into template.md
- "/archive" — Show or update the past issues archive
- "/draft [notes]" — Draft new issue using template, voice, and raw material
- "/subject" — Generate 10 subject line options for current draft
- "/review" — Review draft against voice guide and template
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. Create your newsletter folder
2. Save the CLAUDE.md template
3. Paste an example issue and run `/template` to extract your format
4. Build your archive of past issues
5. Start drafting with your raw notes

## Example Usage

```
"Here's my newsletter format — extract the structure into a template"
"Create an archive tracking my last 10 issues: date, subject, topic"
"This week's raw material: [paste notes]. Draft this week's issue"
"Generate 10 subject lines for this draft"
"Review the draft — does it match my usual voice?"
```

## Tips

- Spend time on the voice guide — it's the difference between generic and authentic
- Track open rates in the archive to learn what topics resonate
- Batch raw material throughout the week, then draft in one session
- Let Claude flag when you're unconsciously repeating themes
