## What This Does

Helps you plan, develop, and maintain consistency in novel-length fiction. Tracks characters, plot threads, worldbuilding details, and timeline while serving as a brainstorming partner for your creative work.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- A folder for your novel project
- Your creative vision (Claude assists, you create)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your novel folder.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Novel Structure

Create your working directory:

```
my-novel/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── manuscript/
│   ├── chapter-01.md
│   └── chapter-02.md
├── bible/
│   ├── characters.md
│   ├── locations.md
│   ├── timeline.md
│   └── plot-outline.md
└── notes/
    └── ideas.md
```

### Step 3: Create Your Story Bible

Start with a `characters.md` file:

```markdown
# Characters

## Protagonists

### Maya Chen
- Age: 32
- Occupation: Detective
- Motivation: Finding her missing sister
- Flaw: Trusts no one
- Arc: Learns to rely on others

## Supporting Cast
...
```

### Step 4: Start Writing

Begin your session:

```
Review my outline and help me brainstorm chapter 3
```

## Example Usage

```
"What's Maya's motivation in this scene?"
"Check for timeline inconsistencies in chapters 1-5"
"Brainstorm three ways this confrontation could go"
"What did I establish about the city's layout?"
"Help me write dialogue for the interrogation scene"
```
