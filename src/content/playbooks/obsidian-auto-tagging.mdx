## What This Does

This playbook analyzes your Obsidian markdown notes and automatically adds relevant tags based on their content. It helps you organize your vault without manually tagging every note.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed and configured
- An Obsidian vault with markdown (.md) files
- Notes that need tagging

## The CLAUDE.md Template

Copy this into a `CLAUDE.md` file in your Obsidian vault root:

```markdown
# Obsidian Auto-Tagger

## Goal
Analyze markdown notes and add relevant YAML frontmatter tags.

## Tag Categories
- Topics: #project, #idea, #meeting, #daily, #weekly, #reference
- Status: #todo, #in-progress, #done, #archived
- Priority: #urgent, #important, #someday
- Areas: #work, #personal, #health, #finance, #learning

## Rules
1. Read each .md file in the vault
2. Analyze the content for themes and topics
3. Add a YAML frontmatter block if missing
4. Add 2-5 relevant tags based on content
5. Don't remove existing tags
6. Don't modify the note content, only frontmatter

## Frontmatter Format
---
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---

## Skip
- Files in .obsidian/ folder
- Files that already have 3+ tags
- Template files in Templates/
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Navigate to your Obsidian vault

```bash
cd ~/Documents/ObsidianVault  # or your vault location
```

### Step 2: Create the CLAUDE.md file

Create a new file called `CLAUDE.md` and paste the template above.

### Step 3: Test on a single note first

Run Claude Code and ask it to tag just one note:

```bash
claude "Tag the note at notes/my-note.md according to the CLAUDE.md rules"
```

### Step 4: Tag all notes (batch)

Once you're happy with the results:

```bash
claude "Tag all untagged notes in this vault according to the CLAUDE.md rules"
```

## Example

**Before (notes/meeting-notes.md):**
```markdown
# Team Standup - January 9

Discussed the new feature rollout. John will handle backend,
Sarah takes frontend. Need to finish by Friday.

Action items:
- Review PR #123
- Update documentation
- Schedule demo with stakeholders
```

**After:**
```markdown
---
tags:
  - meeting
  - work
  - project
  - todo
---

# Team Standup - January 9

Discussed the new feature rollout. John will handle backend,
Sarah takes frontend. Need to finish by Friday.

Action items:
- Review PR #123
- Update documentation
- Schedule demo with stakeholders
```

## Tips & Variations

- **Custom tag vocabulary**: Modify the tag categories to match your existing tagging system
- **Hierarchical tags**: Use nested tags like `#work/meetings` or `#project/alpha`
- **Add more metadata**: Extend the frontmatter to include `created`, `modified`, or custom fields

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Tags don't appear in Obsidian

**Solution**: Make sure the YAML frontmatter is at the very top of the file with no blank lines above it.

**Problem**: Getting irrelevant tags

**Solution**: Refine your tag categories in the CLAUDE.md to be more specific, or add examples of what each tag means.
