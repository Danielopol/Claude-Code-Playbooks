## What This Does

Turn Claude Code into your Obsidian vault assistant. It automatically adds backlinks to daily notes, finds related notes you might have missed, summarizes folders, and keeps frontmatter consistent.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Download the Template

Click the **Download** button above to get the `CLAUDE.md` file.

### Step 2: Place in Your Vault

Move the file to your Obsidian vault root folder:

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/Documents/Obsidian/YourVault/
```

### Step 3: Customize the Template

Open `CLAUDE.md` and update:
- **Vault Structure** - Match your actual folder names
- **Frontmatter Standard** - Match your preferred format
- **Backlinking Rules** - Add your conventions

### Step 4: Start Using

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Obsidian/YourVault
claude
```

Then try: **"Process today's daily note and add backlinks"**

---

## Example Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| "Process today's note" | Adds backlinks to existing notes mentioned |
| "Find related to [[Project X]]" | Finds notes that should link to Project X |
| "Audit frontmatter in Projects/" | Checks for missing/inconsistent fields |
| "Weekly review" | Summarizes this week's notes and changes |
| "Find orphan notes" | Lists notes with no links in or out |

## Tips

- **Start small**: Run on one daily note first to verify it works correctly
- **Review before applying**: Always say "show me what you'd change" before bulk operations
- **Customize patterns**: Add your own linking rules (people, projects, books)
- **Schedule it**: Run the weekly review every Sunday to stay organized

---

## Variations

### For Zettelkasten Users
Add to your CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
## Zettelkasten Rules
- Each note = one main idea
- Use unique IDs in filenames
- Create hub notes for clusters
```

### For PARA Method
Add folder-specific rules for Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive.

### For Daily Notes Power Users
Add rules to auto-link mentions of people, books, and meetings.

## Troubleshooting

**Claude creates phantom links**
Add to CLAUDE.md: "Verify each link target exists before creating"

**Too many suggestions**
Add: "Only link when the connection is meaningful and non-obvious"

**Wrong frontmatter format**
Update the Frontmatter Standard section to match your actual format
