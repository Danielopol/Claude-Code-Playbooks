- Unique files with no backups

---

## Tips

- **Start with Downloads**: Biggest quick wins
- **Check installers**: .dmg/.exe files after installation
- **Empty Trash**: Often forgotten, can be huge
- **Review before delete**: Always preview what's going

"What can I safely delete in Downloads?"
"Find files I haven't touched in a year"
"How much space can I free up?"
"Show me large old files"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Want to keep an old file**
Say: "Keep [filename], it's important"

**Not finding enough**
Extend timeframe: "Find files older than 6 months"

**Worried about deleting wrong thing**
Claude recommends Trash over permanent delete - you can recover
