## What This Does

Extracts people, companies, commitments, and relationship insights from meeting transcripts to build a lightweight personal CRM. Never forget a conversation or miss a follow-up again.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Meeting transcripts (from Otter.ai, Zoom, etc.)
- A folder for your CRM data

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your CRM folder.

### Step 2: Organize Your Transcripts

Create a structure for your meeting files:

```
crm/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── transcripts/
│   ├── 2025-01-15-call-with-sarah.txt
│   └── 2025-01-16-team-standup.txt
├── contacts/
│   └── (auto-generated)
└── insights/
    └── (auto-generated)
```

### Step 3: Process Your First Transcript

Start Claude Code and process a meeting:

```
Process the transcript from my call with Sarah and update my CRM
```

## Example Usage

```
"What did John promise in our last meeting?"
"When did I last talk to the Acme team?"
"Show me all pending follow-ups"
"What topics come up most with [person]?"
"Create a prep brief for my meeting with [person]"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Process promptly** - Details fade from memory quickly
2. **Add context** - Include your own notes alongside transcripts
3. **Review weekly** - Check pending follow-ups
4. **Tag relationships** - Client, prospect, colleague, etc.

## Output Example

For each contact, the system builds profiles like:

```markdown
# Sarah Chen - VP Product @ TechCorp

## Relationship
Type: Prospect
Met: 2024-12-01
Last contact: 2025-01-15
