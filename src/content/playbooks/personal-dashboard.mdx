## What This Does

Generates a customized morning dashboard that pulls together your schedule, priorities, weather, and key metrics. Start each day with a clear picture of what's ahead.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Access to your calendar data (export or API)
- Task list in a text format
- Location for weather

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your dashboard folder.

### Step 2: Configure Your Data Sources

Create a `config.md` file:

```markdown
# Dashboard Config

## Calendar
Source: Google Calendar
File: calendar-export.ics

## Tasks
Source: Todoist export
File: tasks.json

## Weather
Location: San Francisco, CA

## Goals
File: weekly-goals.md
```

### Step 3: Set Up Your Goals

Create `weekly-goals.md`:

```markdown
# Weekly Goals

## Work
- Complete Q1 proposal: 60%
- Ship feature X: 40%

## Personal
- 4 workouts: 2/4
- Read 1 hour/day: 3/5 days
```

### Step 4: Generate Dashboard

Start your morning with:

```
Generate my morning dashboard
```

## Example Usage

```
"What's on my schedule today?"
"Show me tomorrow's preview"
"Create a weekly overview"
"What are my top 3 priorities?"
"How am I tracking on my goals?"
```

## Dashboard Sections

- Date & greeting
- Weather forecast
- Today's schedule
- Priority tasks
- Key metrics
- Weekly goals progress
- Habits checklist

## Best Practices

1. **Make it routine** - Same time each morning
2. **Keep it brief** - 2-3 minute review max
3. **Update goals weekly** - Keep them current
4. **Customize sections** - Remove what you don't use
5. **Set THE ONE THING** - Your must-do for the day
