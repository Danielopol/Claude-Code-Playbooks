## What This Does

Analyze your journal entries, git commits, calendar, or work logs to identify patterns in your behavior, productivity, and mood. Get data-driven insights for self-improvement.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create a Reflection Folder

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Self-Analysis
```

### Step 2: Download the Template

Click **Download** above, then:
```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/Documents/Self-Analysis/
```

### Step 3: Gather Your Data

- Export journal entries
- Pull git commit history
- Export calendar data

### Step 4: Run Claude Code

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Self-Analysis
claude
```

Say: **"Analyze my patterns from the last month"**

## Data Sources

| Source | What It Reveals |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Journal entries** | Mood patterns, recurring concerns |
| **Git commits** | Work patterns, productive times |
| **Calendar** | Meeting load, time allocation |
| **Task completions** | Productivity cycles |
| **Habit tracker** | Consistency, triggers |

---

## Example Analysis

**From 30 days of journal entries + git commits:**

```markdown
## Personal Pattern Analysis

### Key Findings

**Productivity Patterns:**
- Peak coding hours: 9-11 AM and 2-4 PM
- Most commits on Tuesday/Wednesday
- Friday productivity drops 40%

**Mood Correlations:**
- Sleep < 7 hours → negative journal tone next day
- Exercise days → more positive entries
- Back-to-back meetings → lower output

**Recurring Themes:**
1. Impostor syndrome (mentioned 8x)
2. Work-life balance concerns (6x)
3. Project deadline stress (5x)

### Recommendations
1. Protect morning focus time (9-11 AM)
2. Move difficult tasks away from Fridays
3. Build buffer between meeting days
```

## Analysis Types

### Temporal Patterns
- Best/worst days of week
- Time of day productivity
- Seasonal variations
- Monthly cycles

### Correlations
- What happens before good/bad days
- Activity → outcome relationships
- External factors (weather, sleep)
- Social patterns

### Content Analysis
- Recurring topics/concerns
- Sentiment trends
- Language patterns
- Goal progress

## Getting Your Data

### Journal Entries
```bash
# Day One export
# App Settings > Export > JSON

# Obsidian daily notes
cat ~/Obsidian/Daily/*.md > all_journals.txt

# Apple Notes (via script)
# Various export tools available
```

### Git Commit History
```bash
# Your commits from last 90 days
git log --author="Your Name" --since="90 days ago" \
  --format="%ad | %s" --date=short > commits.txt

# With statistics
git log --author="Your Name" --since="90 days ago" \
  --format="%ad %H %s" --date=iso --stat > commits_detailed.txt
```

### Calendar Data
```bash
# Google Calendar: Settings > Import & Export > Export
# Apple Calendar: File > Export

# Or use CLI tools
gcalcli agenda --nocolor > calendar.txt
```

## Tips

- **Consistency matters**: More data = better patterns
- **Be honest**: Authentic entries give real insights
- **Context helps**: Note external factors (sleep, events)
- **Revisit regularly**: Patterns change over time
- **Act on insights**: Analysis without action is useless

---

## Commands

```
"Analyze my journal entries for patterns"
"What are my most productive times?"
"Find correlations in my data"
"Compare this month to last month"
"What themes keep coming up?"
"When do I write most positively?"
"Generate weekly reflection prompts"
"What should I do differently?"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Not enough data**
Start with a week of consistent tracking, build from there

**Patterns seem random**
Add more context to entries (sleep, exercise, events)

**Analysis feels off**
Provide more context about your life/work for better interpretation
