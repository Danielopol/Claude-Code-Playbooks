## What This Does

Organize thousands of photos into meaningful folders by analyzing EXIF metadata (date, location) and image content. Photos are grouped into events and organized into a Year > Month > Event structure.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Download the Template

Click **Download** above to get the `CLAUDE.md` file.

### Step 2: Place in Photos Folder

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/Pictures/
```

### Step 3: Run Claude Code

```bash
cd ~/Pictures
claude
```

### Step 4: Start Organizing

## Folder Structure Created

```
Photos/
├── 2025/
│   ├── 01-January/
│   │   ├── 2025-01-15_Birthday-Party/
│   │   ├── 2025-01-22_Hiking-Trip/
│   │   └── Misc/
│   ├── 02-February/
│   └── ...
└── Screenshots/
```

## How Events Are Detected

| Signal | How It's Used |
|--------|---------------|
| Time proximity | Photos within 2-3 hours = same event |
| GPS location | Same coordinates = same event |
| Visual similarity | Similar backgrounds/people grouped |
| Date gaps | New day often = new event |

---

## Example Output

**Before:** 2,000 files named `IMG_1234.jpg`

**After:**
```
2025-01-15_Birthday-Party-John/ (47 photos)
2025-01-22_Hiking-Mount-Tam/ (83 photos)
2025-02-14_Dinner-Downtown/ (12 photos)
```

Plus a `photo-organization-report.md` with full inventory.

## Tips

- **Screenshots separated**: Automatically moved to `Screenshots/` folder
- **Duplicates flagged**: Same timestamp photos marked for review
- **No EXIF fallback**: Uses file date if metadata missing
- **Videos included**: Grouped with photos from same event

---

## Troubleshooting

**Photos not grouped correctly**
Adjust time window: "Group photos within 4 hours as same event"

**Wrong event names**
Say: "Rename the January 15 event to 'John's 30th Birthday'"

**Missing EXIF data**
Claude uses file dates as fallback and flags these for review
