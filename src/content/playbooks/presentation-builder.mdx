## Prerequisites

- Web browser for presenting
- Your presentation content/outline

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your presentations folder.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Content

Create an outline of your presentation:

```markdown
# My Presentation Outline

## Topic
Q1 Sales Review

## Audience
Executive team

## Key Points
1. Revenue exceeded targets by 15%
2. New customer acquisition up 25%
3. Challenges in APAC region
4. Q2 priorities
```

### Step 3: Generate Presentation

Start Claude Code and create your slides:

```
Create a presentation from my outline about Q1 sales results
```

## Example Usage

```
"Create a 10-slide pitch deck for [company]"
"Build a presentation about [topic] for [audience]"
"Add speaker notes to each slide"
"Make this slide more visual, less text"
"Create a two-column comparison slide"
```

## Using Your Presentation

### Present Directly
1. Open the HTML file in your browser
2. Press `S` for speaker view
3. Use arrow keys to navigate

### Export Options
- Print to PDF from browser
- Copy content to PowerPoint
- Import HTML to Google Slides

## Best Practices

1. **One idea per slide** - Don't overcrowd
2. **6x6 rule** - Max 6 bullets, 6 words each
3. **Headlines tell the story** - Should be readable alone
4. **Speaker notes are key** - Put details there, not slides
5. **Specify your audience** - Tone adjusts accordingly

## Slide Types Available

- Title slide
- Agenda/Overview
- Content with bullets
- Two-column comparison
- Quote slide
- Data/Chart slide
- Summary/Recap
