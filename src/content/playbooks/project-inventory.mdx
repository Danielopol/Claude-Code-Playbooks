## What This Does

Scans your projects folder to understand each project: what it does, tech stack used, status (active/archived), health metrics, and creates a documented inventory for future reference.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Projects folder to analyze
- Interest in understanding your own work

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your projects folder.

### Step 2: Point to Your Projects

Identify what to analyze:

```
projects/
├── project-a/
├── project-b/
├── old-stuff/
└── experiments/
```

### Step 3: Run Inventory

Start the analysis:

```
Analyze my projects folder and create an inventory
```

## Example Usage

```
"What's this project for?" (in project directory)
"Which projects use React?"
"Find all abandoned projects"
"Generate README for this project"
"What's the health of my projects?"
```

## What Gets Documented

- **Purpose**: What each project does
- **Tech stack**: Languages, frameworks, dependencies
- **Status**: Active, archived, abandoned
- **Health**: Last updated, dependency freshness
- **Key files**: Entry points, configs

## Best Practices

1. **Review quarterly** - Keep status current
2. **Archive properly** - Don't delete, archive
3. **Document as you go** - Update with changes
4. **Note dependencies** - Version requirements matter
