## Example Output

```markdown
## Understanding Your Situation

Based on our conversations, [Company] is facing:

1. "We're hiring 5 SDRs but ramp time is
   killing us" (from Jan 15 call)

2. Pipeline quality dropping as team scales
   (mentioned in follow-up email)

## Addressing Your Concerns

You asked: "What if it doesn't work for us?"

Our answer: 90-day pilot with full refund
if you don't see 30% ramp improvement...
```

---

## Tips

- **Quote their words**: Shows you listened
- **Address objections proactively**: Don't wait for pushback
- **Tiered options**: Let them choose their commitment level
- **Relevant proof**: Case studies in their industry/size

---

## Commands

```
"Generate proposal based on these call notes"
"Add objection handling for [concern]"
"Create 3 pricing tiers for [scope]"
"Find a relevant case study for [industry]"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Proposal feels generic**
Add more call notes: "Here's what they said about..."

**Missing key concerns**
Say: "They also worried about [X], address that"

**Wrong tone**
Specify: "Make it more formal" or "Keep it conversational"
