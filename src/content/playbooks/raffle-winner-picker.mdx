## Tips

- **Save the seed**: For reproducible results if questioned
- **Draw backups**: Always have alternates ready
- **Document everything**: Timestamp, method, results
- **Announce publicly**: Builds trust in the process
- **Check eligibility**: Verify winners before announcing

```
"Pick 3 winners from entries.csv"
"Draw a winner with weighted entries"
"Select 5 winners plus 3 backups"
"Pick from this list: [paste names]"
"Generate verification report"

## Troubleshooting

**Duplicate entries**
Ask: "Remove duplicate emails before drawing"

**Need proof of randomness**
Say: "Include cryptographic verification"

**Winner is ineligible**
Ask: "Move to backup winner #1"
