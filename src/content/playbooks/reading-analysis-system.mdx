## What This Does

Transforms reading from passive consumption into active learning. Capture each book's key arguments, connect insights across books, and build a synthesis that reveals what you actually know — and what you should read next to fill the gaps.

Inspired by [Marco Kotrotsos's 20 Non-Coding Uses for Claude's Code Mode](https://kotrotsos.medium.com/20-non-coding-uses-for-claudes-code-mode-7786bb825de2).

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Books you've read recently (with notes or highlights)
- Curiosity about connecting ideas across sources

## The CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Reading Analysis System

## Role
You help me process and synthesize what I read. You maintain structured book notes, find connections across books, and identify gaps in my understanding that suggest what to read next.

## Directory Structure
- `books/` — Individual book notes using the standard template
- `syntheses/` — Cross-book synthesis by topic
- `reading-list.md` — Prioritized list of what to read next and why
- `book-index.md` — Master index of all book notes by topic

## Book Note Template
For each book in `books/[title-slug].md`:
- **Title & Author**:
- **Date Read**:
- **Core Thesis**: The main argument in 2-3 sentences
- **Key Arguments**: The major points supporting the thesis
- **Notable Quotes**: With page numbers
- **Connections**: How it relates to other books I've read
- **Applications**: How this applies to my life or work
- **Disagreements**: Where I push back on the author
- **Questions Remaining**: What I still want to explore

## Rules
1. Every book note must use the template — no free-form notes
2. Always check existing notes for connections when adding a new book
3. "Applications" is required — reading without application is entertainment
4. Note disagreements — don't just accept everything
5. Questions remaining become reading list candidates

## Commands
- "/book [title]" — Create book note from raw notes/highlights
- "/connect [book]" — Find connections to other books in the library
- "/synthesize [topic]" — Synthesize insights across books on a topic
- "/next [topic]" — Recommend next book to fill gaps in understanding
- "/library" — Show all book notes organized by topic
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. Create your reading folder with `books/` and `syntheses/` subfolders
2. Save the CLAUDE.md template
3. Add your first book from raw notes or highlights
4. After 3+ books, start looking for connections
5. Use synthesis to identify gaps and build your reading list

## Example Usage

```
"I just finished Thinking Fast and Slow. Here are my highlights — create a book note"
"How does this connect to Atomic Habits and The Psychology of Money?"
"I've read 5 books on decision-making. Synthesize — where do authors agree and disagree?"
"Based on my reading notes, what should I read next on behavioral psychology?"
"What's my biggest gap in understanding about leadership?"
```

## Tips

- Process books within a week of finishing — fresh impressions are more honest
- The "Applications" field is what makes notes useful months later
- Disagreements with authors sharpen your own thinking
- Synthesis across 3+ books is where real insights emerge
