## What This Does

Analyzes job postings to identify keywords and requirements, then helps you tailor your resume to match while maintaining truthfulness. Optimizes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) that screen resumes before human review.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Your master resume
- Job posting(s) you're applying to

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your job search folder.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Master Resume

Create a comprehensive version with all experience:

```
job-search/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── resume-master.md
├── versions/
│   └── (tailored versions go here)
└── job-postings/
    └── (save interesting postings)
```

### Step 3: Tailor for a Job

Start Claude Code and customize:

```
Tailor my resume for this Product Manager role at Google: [paste job posting]
```

## Example Usage

```
"Analyze this job posting for keywords"
"What requirements am I missing?"
"Rewrite this bullet to match their requirements"
"Check my resume for ATS compatibility"
"Generate a matching cover letter"
"How do I address the experience gap?"
```

## What Gets Analyzed

- **Keywords**: Technical skills, soft skills, industry terms
- **Requirements**: Must-have vs. nice-to-have
- **Culture signals**: Company values and language
- **ATS optimization**: Formatting and keyword density

## Best Practices

1. **Be truthful** - Tailor framing, never fabricate
2. **Use their language** - Mirror job posting phrases
3. **Quantify achievements** - Numbers catch attention
4. **One page if possible** - Unless senior/academic
5. **Save versions** - Track what you sent where
