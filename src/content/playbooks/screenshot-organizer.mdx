## What This Does

Screenshots pile up with useless names like "Screenshot 2024-01-15 at 3.42.17 PM.png". Claude analyzes the **visual content** of each image - reading text, identifying apps - and renames them meaningfully.

> "Organized 1,400 screenshots. Fair warning: batch renaming images was surprisingly slow (20+ seconds for 8-10 images). But still faster than doing it manually." — Wondering About AI

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Download the Template

Click **Download** above to get the `CLAUDE.md` file.

### Step 2: Place in Screenshots Folder

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/Pictures/Screenshots/
```

### Step 3: Run Claude Code

```bash
cd ~/Pictures/Screenshots
claude
```

### Step 4: Start Organizing

Say: **"Organize my screenshots folder"**

For large folders, add the count: **"Organize my screenshots folder (1,400 files)"**

## Naming Convention

**Before:**
```

```

**After:**
```
2025-01-15 - Work - Slack conversation Q1 planning.png
2025-01-15 - Receipts - Amazon $127.43 office supplies.png
2025-01-12 - Reference - VS Code keyboard shortcuts.png
```

## Category Folders

| Folder | What Goes Here |
|--------|---------------|
| Work/ | Slack, email, documents, meetings |
| Receipts/ | Invoices, orders, payment confirmations |
| Social Media/ | Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit posts |
| Reference/ | Tutorials, docs, how-tos, code snippets |
| Personal/ | Personal messages, non-work items |
| Other/ | Anything that doesn't fit |

---

## Index File

Claude creates a searchable `screenshots-index.md`:

```markdown
# Screenshot Index

## Work (47 files)
- 2025-01-15 - Slack Q1 planning discussion
- 2025-01-14 - Figma dashboard mockup v2

## Receipts (23 files)
- 2025-01-15 - Amazon $127.43 office supplies
- 2025-01-12 - Uber $24.50 airport trip
```

Now you can search with `grep` or your editor!

## Performance Tips

| File Count | Expected Time | Recommendation |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| < 100 | 5-10 minutes | Run anytime |
| 100-500 | 20-45 minutes | Take a break |
| 500-1000 | 1-2 hours | Run during lunch |
| 1000+ | 2+ hours | Run overnight |

**Why slow?** Claude analyzes each image's visual content, which takes ~2-3 seconds per file.

---

## Tips

- **Process in batches**: Claude handles 50 files at a time to manage memory
- **Run overnight**: For 1000+ screenshots, start before bed
- **Check the index**: Use `screenshots-index.md` to search later
- **Receipt extraction**: Claude pulls vendor names and amounts automatically

---

## Special Handling

### Receipts & Invoices
Claude extracts vendor and amount:
```
2025-01-15 - Receipts - Amazon $127.43 office supplies.png
```

### Code Screenshots
Notes the language and topic:
```
2025-01-13 - Reference - React useEffect cleanup pattern.png
```

### Error Messages
Captures the error type:
```
2025-01-14 - Reference - Python TypeError list index.png
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Too slow**
Process smaller batches: "Organize just the screenshots from January"

**Some files not analyzed**
Low-quality or very small images may not be readable. Claude reports these.

**Wrong category assigned**
Say: "Move [filename] to [correct category]"

**Want different categories**
Edit the CLAUDE.md template to add your own folder structure
