## What This Does

Helps you find and recover work from past Claude Code sessions. Search for code snippets, file changes, solutions, or commands you forgot to save.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Previous sessions to search
- Some memory of what you're looking for

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below for reference.

### Step 2: Gather Clues

Think about:
- When (approximately) you did the work
- What files were involved
- Keywords from the conversation
- The problem you were solving

### Step 3: Search History

Start searching:

```
Find the session where I created [file/solution]
```

## Example Usage

```
"What did I work on yesterday?"
"Find code that [description]"
"Search for my solution to [problem]"
"List sessions for [project]"
"Export code from that session"
```

## Search Strategies

- **By date**: "What did I do last Tuesday?"
- **By content**: "Find the function that..."
- **By file**: "When did I create..."
- **By problem**: "That bug I fixed with..."

## Recovery Types

- Code snippets and functions
- File creation history
- Commands that were run
- Solutions that worked
- Configurations made

## Best Practices

1. **Save important work** - Don't rely on history alone
2. **Use descriptive names** - Makes searching easier
3. **Note what you're solving** - Future context helps
4. **Regular exports** - For critical solutions
