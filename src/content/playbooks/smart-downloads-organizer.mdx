## What This Does

Unlike basic file organizers that only look at extensions, this playbook analyzes file **contents** to organize intelligently. A PDF recipe goes to `Recipes/`, while a PDF invoice goes to `Finance/`.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Download the Template

Click the **Download** button above to get the `CLAUDE.md` file.

### Step 2: Place in Downloads

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/Downloads/
```

### Step 3: Run Claude Code

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
claude
```

Then say: **"Analyze my downloads and show me how you'd organize them"**

### Step 4: Review & Approve

Claude will show you a table of proposed moves. Review it, then say **"Go ahead"** to execute.

## Default Categories

The template organizes into these folders:

| Category | What Goes Here |
|----------|---------------|
| Finance/ | Invoices, receipts, bank statements |
| Work/ | Reports, presentations, work docs |
| Recipes/ | Food recipes, cooking guides |
| Reading/ | Articles, ebooks, PDFs to read |
| Images/Photos/ | Personal photos |
| Images/Screenshots/ | App screenshots, UI captures |
| Reference/ | Manuals, guides, documentation |
| Archives/ | .zip, .rar files |
| Installers/ | .dmg, .exe, .pkg files |

## Tips

- **Always preview first**: Start with "show me what you'd do" before moving anything
- **Customize categories**: Edit the CLAUDE.md to match your workflow
- **Run weekly**: Make it a Sunday habit to keep Downloads clean
- **Skip in-use files**: Claude won't touch files that are currently open

---

## Customization Ideas

### Add Project Detection
```markdown
## Project Detection
Group related files (same name pattern, similar dates) into Projects/[Name]/
```

### Add Date-Based Sorting
```markdown
## Date Sorting
For photos, create year/month subfolders: Images/2026/01/
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Too many files in Unsorted/**
Add more specific categories to CLAUDE.md for your common file types

**Claude wants to move a file I'm using**
Say "Skip [filename], I'm using it"

**Slow on large folders**
Process in batches: "Organize files from the last 7 days"
