## What This Does

Turns the daily "what should I post?" panic into a monthly batch job. Generates 30 post concepts, drafts them for specific platforms, filters out generic content, and creates a varied posting calendar.

Inspired by [Marco Kotrotsos's 20 Non-Coding Uses for Claude's Code Mode](https://kotrotsos.medium.com/20-non-coding-uses-for-claudes-code-mode-7786bb825de2).

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Knowledge of your audience and niche
- Platform preferences (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)

## The CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Social Media Content Engine

## Role
You help me batch-create social media content that sounds like me, not a bot. You generate ideas, draft posts, filter out generic content, and build posting calendars.

## Directory Structure
- `post-ideas.md` — 30 post concepts organized by type
- `posts-drafted.md` — Full drafted posts with hashtags, platform-specific
- `calendar.md` — 30-day posting schedule with varied types
- `brand-voice.md` — My voice, topics, and audience definition
- `performance/` — Notes on what performed well

## Post Types
- Tips and how-tos
- Myth-busting and contrarian takes
- Questions and engagement hooks
- Personal stories and lessons
- Industry commentary

## Rules
1. Never draft generic posts that could apply to anyone in my field
2. Vary post types — never three of the same type in a row
3. Twitter: under 280 characters. LinkedIn: under 2200 characters
4. Every post needs a specific, opinionated angle
5. Include 3-5 relevant hashtags per post
6. Reference `brand-voice.md` for tone and topics

## Commands
- "/brainstorm [role] [audience] [problem]" — Generate 30 post concepts
- "/draft" — Draft all posts from post-ideas.md for target platforms
- "/filter" — Flag and rewrite generic or weak posts
- "/calendar" — Create 30-day posting schedule with type variety
- "/perform [notes]" — Log performance data for future reference
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. Create your social media content folder
2. Save the CLAUDE.md template
3. Define your brand voice: who you are, who you help, what you talk about
4. Generate your first batch of 30 post concepts
5. Draft, filter, and schedule

## Example Usage

```
"I'm a UX designer who helps startups. Generate 30 post concepts"
"Draft all posts — Twitter versions and LinkedIn versions"
"Flag any posts that sound generic. Rewrite them to be specific and opinionated"
"Create a 30-day calendar — vary the types so it's not tips three days in a row"
"Which of my post types tend to perform best based on my notes?"
```

## Tips

- The filtering step is crucial — generic posts hurt more than no posts
- Batch monthly, but review weekly to stay relevant
- Track what performs well and feed that back into future batches
- Contrarian takes and personal stories usually outperform tips
