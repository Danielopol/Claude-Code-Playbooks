## What This Does

This playbook turns Claude Code into a private tutor that teaches you how real-world software works by reading actual source code. Instead of relying on documentation or blog posts, you clone the repository of a system you want to understand, and Claude explains it directly from the implementation. When Claude gets stuck or gives a vague answer, pointing it to the actual source code produces "instant enlightenment."

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed and configured
- Git installed for cloning repositories
- A system or library you want to learn about

## The CLAUDE.md Template

Copy this into a `CLAUDE.md` file in your learning project folder:

```markdown
# Source Code Learner

## Goal
Teach me how this software system works by reading its actual source code. Explain concepts clearly, trace execution paths, and connect implementation details to higher-level design principles.

## Teaching Rules
1. Always reference specific files and line numbers when explaining concepts
2. Start with the big picture (architecture overview) before diving into details
3. Use analogies to explain complex patterns
4. When I ask "how does X work?", trace the actual code path, don't just describe it abstractly
5. If you're unsure about something, say so and read more source files before answering
6. Create learning notes in `notes/` to track what we've covered
7. Use diagrams (ASCII or Mermaid) to illustrate architecture and data flow

## Learning Session Format
When starting a new topic:
1. **Overview**: What is this component and why does it exist?
2. **Entry Point**: Where does execution begin for this feature?
3. **Code Walk**: Step through the key code paths
4. **Design Patterns**: What patterns are used and why?
5. **Trade-offs**: What design trade-offs were made?
6. **Summary**: Save a note to `notes/` with key takeaways

## Directory Structure
- `src/` or `repo/` — The cloned source code (read-only)
- `notes/` — Learning notes generated during sessions
- `diagrams/` — Architecture and flow diagrams
- `questions/` — Questions to explore in future sessions

## Commands
- "Give me an architecture overview" — High-level system design
- "How does [feature] work?" — Deep dive into a specific feature
- "Trace [function/request]" — Follow execution from entry to exit
- "Compare [component A] vs [component B]" — Comparative analysis
- "Quiz me on [topic]" — Test understanding of what we've covered
- "What should I learn next?" — Suggest the next logical topic based on what we've covered
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create a learning project folder

```bash
mkdir -p ~/learn-rabbitmq/{notes,diagrams,questions}
cd ~/learn-rabbitmq
```

### Step 2: Clone the source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server.git repo
```

Replace with whatever system you want to learn:
- **RabbitMQ**: `https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server`
- **Redis**: `https://github.com/redis/redis`
- **PostgreSQL**: `https://github.com/postgres/postgres`
- **Node.js**: `https://github.com/nodejs/node`
- **React**: `https://github.com/facebook/react`
- **Linux Kernel**: `https://github.com/torvalds/linux`

### Step 3: Save the CLAUDE.md and launch

Copy the template above into `CLAUDE.md`, then:

```bash
cd ~/learn-rabbitmq
claude
```

Try: "Give me an architecture overview of RabbitMQ. What are the main components and how do they interact?"

## Example Usage

**Start with the big picture:**
> "Read the repository structure and give me a high-level architecture overview. What are the main modules and how do they relate to each other?"

**Deep dive into a feature:**
> "How does RabbitMQ handle message acknowledgment? Trace the code path from when a consumer sends an ack to when the message is removed from the queue."

**Understand a design pattern:**
> "I see this project uses the actor model. Show me where actors are defined in the code and how message passing works between them."

**Compare implementations:**
> "How does this project's consensus algorithm compare to Raft? Show me the actual implementation."

**When Claude gets stuck:**
> "You seem unsure about how the storage engine works. Read the files in src/storage/ and then explain it to me."

**Generate study notes:**
> "Create a summary note of everything we've covered about the message routing system. Save it to notes/message-routing.md."

## Suggested Learning Projects

| System | What You'll Learn |
|--------|------------------|
| Redis | Data structures, event loops, persistence strategies |
| PostgreSQL | Query planning, MVCC, WAL, indexing |
| RabbitMQ | Message queuing, AMQP protocol, clustering |
| Kafka | Distributed logs, partitioning, consumer groups |
| React | Virtual DOM, reconciliation, hooks |
| Express.js | Middleware patterns, routing, HTTP handling |
| SQLite | Database internals in a single file |
| Git | Content-addressable storage, DAGs, merge strategies |

## Tips

- **Read the source when Claude fumbles**: If Claude gives a vague or incorrect answer, tell it to read the specific source files. Going from abstract knowledge to actual code produces dramatically better explanations.
- **Start with smaller projects**: SQLite or Express.js are easier to learn from than the Linux kernel. Start small and work up.
- **Use the notes folder**: Having Claude generate notes creates a persistent study guide you can review later and across sessions.
- **Ask "why" not just "how"**: The most valuable learning comes from understanding design trade-offs, not just what the code does.
- **Clone a specific version**: Use `git checkout v3.12.0` to study a stable release rather than a moving main branch.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Claude gives generic explanations instead of referencing code

**Solution**: Be specific — "Show me the actual code in [filename] that handles this" rather than "How does this work?" Force Claude to cite file paths and line numbers.

**Problem**: Repository is too large for Claude to navigate

**Solution**: Start by asking Claude to identify the key directories, then focus on one subsystem at a time. You don't need to read the entire codebase — just the parts relevant to what you're learning.

**Problem**: Claude's explanation doesn't match what I see in the code

**Solution**: Claude's training data may be from an older version. Always verify by asking Claude to read the current file: "Read src/queue/manager.rs and tell me what it actually does."
