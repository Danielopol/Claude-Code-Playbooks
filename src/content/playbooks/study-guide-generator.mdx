## What This Does

Converts textbooks, lecture notes, and syllabi into organized study materials. Creates concept summaries, practice questions at different difficulty levels, and flashcard-ready content for effective exam preparation.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Course materials (notes, textbook PDFs, syllabus)
- Exam information (topics, format, date)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your study folder.

### Step 2: Organize Your Materials

```
course-study/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── materials/
│   ├── lecture-notes/
│   ├── textbook-chapters/
│   └── syllabus.pdf
├── study-guides/
└── flashcards/
```

### Step 3: Generate Your Guide

Start Claude Code and create your study guide:

```
Create a study guide for my Biology 101 midterm covering chapters 1-5
```

## Example Usage

```
"Generate practice questions on photosynthesis"
"Make flashcards for Chapter 3 vocabulary"
"Explain [concept] in simple terms"
"Create a study schedule for my exam on [date]"
"What are the key concepts I need to know?"
"Quiz me on cellular respiration"
```

## Output Types

- **Concept summaries**: Key ideas explained clearly
- **Practice questions**: Recall, application, analysis
- **Flashcards**: Term/definition pairs
- **Study schedules**: Day-by-day plans
- **Comparison tables**: Related concepts side-by-side

## Best Practices

1. **Start early** - Don't cram the night before
2. **Active recall** - Test yourself, don't just re-read
3. **Teach it** - Explain concepts to verify understanding
4. **Space it out** - Review over multiple sessions
5. **Focus on gaps** - Spend time on what you don't know
