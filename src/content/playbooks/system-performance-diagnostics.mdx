## What This Does

Diagnose why your computer is running slow. Claude runs performance checks, identifies bottlenecks, and provides prioritized fixes ranked by impact and ease of implementation.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Download the Template

Click **Download** above, then place in your home folder:
```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/
```

### Step 2: Run Claude Code

```bash
cd ~
claude
```

### Step 3: Ask

Say: **"Why is my computer running slow?"**

---

## What Gets Checked

| Category | Checks |
|----------|--------|
| **CPU** | Usage, runaway processes, thermal throttling |
| **Memory** | RAM usage, swap pressure, memory leaks |
| **Disk** | Space, I/O bottlenecks, fragmentation |
| **Network** | Bandwidth usage, DNS issues, connections |
| **Startup** | Login items, launch agents, services |
| **Background** | Hidden processes, scheduled tasks |

## Example Output

```markdown
## Performance Report

### System Status
- CPU: 85% (HIGH - browser using 60%)
- Memory: 14.2/16 GB (HIGH)
- Disk: 92% full (CRITICAL)
- Uptime: 34 days (recommend restart)

### Top Issues

| Priority | Issue | Impact | Fix |
|----------|-------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Chrome using 8GB RAM | High | Close unused tabs |
| 2 | Disk nearly full | High | Clear 50GB |
| 3 | 45 startup items | Med | Disable 30 |

### Quick Fixes (Do Now)
1. Restart computer (34 day uptime)
2. Close Chrome tabs (87 open)
3. Empty Trash (12 GB)
```

## Common Causes

### High CPU
- Browser tabs (especially video)
- Runaway processes
- Indexing services
- Malware/cryptominers

### High Memory
- Too many apps open
- Browser memory leaks
- Memory-hungry apps
- Insufficient RAM

### Slow Disk
- Nearly full (< 10% free)
- Old spinning drive
- Too many small files
- Fragmentation (Windows)

### General Slowness
- Too long since restart
- Outdated OS
- Too many startup items
- Background updates

---

## Platform-Specific Checks

### macOS
```
Activity Monitor processes
Spotlight indexing status
Time Machine operations
Login items
LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons
```

### Windows
```
Task Manager processes
Windows Update status
Startup programs
Services
Disk defragmentation needs
```

### Linux
```
top/htop processes
systemd services
swap usage
journalctl logs
cron jobs
```

---

## Tips

- **Regular restarts**: Weekly at minimum
- **Keep 15%+ free**: Disk space affects performance
- **Audit startup items**: Most aren't needed
- **Browser hygiene**: Extensions and tabs matter
- **Update regularly**: Performance fixes in updates

---

## Commands

```
"Why is my computer slow?"
"Check CPU usage"
"What's using all my memory?"
"Find resource-heavy processes"
"What's running at startup?"
"How can I speed up my computer?"
"Run a full system diagnostic"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Can't find the issue**
Ask: "Run a comprehensive diagnostic and compare to baseline"

**Fixes didn't help**
Say: "The quick fixes didn't work, dig deeper"

**Problem is intermittent**
Ask: "Monitor system for the next hour and report anomalies"
