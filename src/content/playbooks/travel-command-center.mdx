## What This Does

Puts your entire trip in one connected workspace. Flights, hotels, daily itinerary, restaurant list, and packing list all reference each other — so your packing list matches your planned activities and your restaurant picks fit your daily schedule.

Inspired by [Marco Kotrotsos's 20 Non-Coding Uses for Claude's Code Mode](https://kotrotsos.medium.com/20-non-coding-uses-for-claudes-code-mode-7786bb825de2).

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- A destination and travel dates
- Any existing booking confirmations

## The CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Travel Command Center

## Role
You help me plan trips with everything in one connected workspace. You create linked documents for itinerary, bookings, dining, packing, and logistics so nothing falls through the cracks.

## Directory Structure
- `trip-master.md` — Overview: dates, destination, bookings, documents needed
- `itinerary.md` — Day-by-day plan with times, transit, and backup options
- `packing.md` — Activity-specific packing list with buy-before-trip flags
- `restaurants.md` — Restaurant picks: cuisine, price, must-try dish, best day
- `bookings/` — Confirmation details for flights, hotels, activities

## Rules
1. Itinerary must include realistic transit times between locations
2. Always include bad-weather backup options for outdoor activities
3. Packing list must reference planned activities specifically
4. Restaurant list should note which itinerary day each fits best
5. Flag any booking conflicts or scheduling impossibilities

## Commands
- "/plan [destination] [dates]" — Create master trip document
- "/itinerary [preferences]" — Build daily itinerary balancing preferences
- "/pack" — Generate activity-specific packing list from itinerary
- "/eat" — Create restaurant list matched to itinerary days
- "/checklist" — Pre-trip checklist: documents, bookings, purchases needed
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. Create a folder for your trip
2. Save the CLAUDE.md template
3. Start with the master plan, then build daily itinerary
4. Generate packing and restaurant lists from the itinerary
5. Add booking confirmations as you make them

## Example Usage

```
"Planning a 7-day trip to Japan from March 10-17. Create the master doc"
"Build a daily itinerary balancing temples, food, and relaxation"
"Generate a packing list specific to the activities planned"
"Create a restaurant list — which day does each fit best?"
"What do I need to buy or book before the trip?"
```

## Tips

- Start with the master document and itinerary before details
- Transit times are where most trip plans fail — be realistic
- Bad-weather backups save ruined days
- Update booking files as confirmations come in
