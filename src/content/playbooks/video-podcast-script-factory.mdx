## What This Does

Takes a rough episode concept and builds it into a production-ready script with cold opens, transitions, visual cues, and companion documents (thumbnails, descriptions, timestamps). By the time you hit record, you know exactly what you're saying.

Inspired by [Marco Kotrotsos's 20 Non-Coding Uses for Claude's Code Mode](https://kotrotsos.medium.com/20-non-coding-uses-for-claudes-code-mode-7786bb825de2).

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- A content topic or episode idea
- Target platform (YouTube, podcast, etc.)

## The CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Video/Podcast Script Factory

## Role
You help me turn rough ideas into production-ready scripts. You develop angles, build structures, write full scripts with visual/audio cues, and create companion production documents.

## Directory Structure
- `angles.md` — Different angles for the topic with hooks and viewer value
- `outline.md` — Detailed episode structure with transitions
- `script.md` — Full script with [VISUAL] and [AUDIO] cues
- `production-notes.md` — Timestamps, thumbnails, titles, description, keywords
- `archive/` — Past scripts for reference

## Script Format
- [COLD OPEN] — Hook that grabs in first 10 seconds
- [INTRO] — Brief context and promise
- [SECTION 1-N] — Main content with transitions
- [VISUAL: description] — B-roll or graphic cues
- [AUDIO: description] — Sound effect or music cues
- [CTA] — Specific call-to-action
- [OUTRO] — Wrap-up

## Rules
1. Every script starts with a hook — no throat-clearing
2. Transitions between sections must be explicit
3. Mark moments that need visual support with [VISUAL]
4. Target time: specify in outline, then pace the script accordingly
5. Production notes include 5 title options and 3 thumbnail concepts

## Commands
- "/angles [topic]" — Generate 5 angles with hooks and viewer value
- "/outline [angle #]" — Build detailed episode outline
- "/script" — Expand outline into full script with cues
- "/production" — Create companion doc: timestamps, titles, thumbnails, description
- "/adapt [format]" — Adapt script for different format (short, reel, podcast)
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. Create your content production folder
2. Save the CLAUDE.md template
3. Start with a topic and generate angles
4. Choose an angle and build the outline
5. Expand to full script with production notes

## Example Usage

```
"Topic: why most productivity advice fails. Generate 5 different angles"
"Using angle #3, create a detailed outline for a 10-minute video"
"Expand the outline into a full script with visual cues for B-roll"
"Create production notes: timestamps, 5 title options, thumbnail ideas"
"Adapt this script into a 60-second short version"
```

## Tips

- Spend most time on the angle and hook — the rest follows
- [VISUAL] cues save hours in editing by planning B-roll upfront
- Always write more titles than you think you need
- Keep a script archive to identify your natural patterns
