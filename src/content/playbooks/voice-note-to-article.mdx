## What This Does

Turn messy voice notes, brainstorms, and rambling recordings into structured article outlines and polished drafts. Perfect for capturing ideas on the go and turning them into content.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create a Writing Folder

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Writing
```

### Step 2: Download the Template

Click **Download** above, then:
```bash
mv ~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md ~/Documents/Writing/
```

### Step 3: Add Your Voice Note

Either:
- Save transcription as `voice-note.txt`
- Use a transcription service (Otter, Whisper)
- Paste the text directly

### Step 4: Run Claude Code

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Writing
claude
```

Say: **"Turn my voice note into an article outline"**

## Example

**Input (messy voice note):**
```
Okay so I've been thinking about, um, productivity apps
and like why most of them fail? It's because... they add
too many features. Nobody needs that. What people actually
want is just... you know, simplicity. Like the best apps
do one thing well. Oh and another thing - they try to
change your behavior instead of fitting into how you
already work. That's backwards. Anyway, might write
something about this...
```

**Output:**

```markdown
## Article Outline: Why Productivity Apps Fail

### Main Thesis
Most productivity apps fail because they prioritize features
over simplicity and try to change user behavior rather than
adapting to existing workflows.

### Section 1: The Feature Bloat Problem
- Apps keep adding features nobody asked for
- Complexity creates friction
- Users want tools that "just work"

### Section 2: The Behavior Change Trap
- Apps try to impose new habits
- Successful apps adapt to existing workflows
- Meet users where they are

### Section 3: What Great Apps Do Differently
- Focus on doing one thing well
- Minimize learning curve
- Enhance existing behaviors

### Suggested Title Options
1. "Why Most Productivity Apps Miss the Point"
2. "The Two Mistakes Every Productivity App Makes"
3. "Less Is More: A Manifesto for Simple Tools"
```

## Tips

- **Don't edit while recording**: Let ideas flow freely
- **Repeat key points**: Helps identify what matters
- **Name your topic**: Say "This is about X" somewhere
- **Include examples**: They translate well to writing
- **Note your audience**: Mention who you're writing for

---

## Commands

```
"Turn this voice note into an outline"
"Create a full draft from my notes"
"What are the main points in this recording?"
"Organize my thoughts into sections"
"Make this into a Twitter thread"
"What's missing from my argument?"
"Suggest a title and intro"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Outline seems scattered**
Your note may have multiple topics. Ask: "What are the distinct topics here?"

**Missing your main point**
Say: "The main point I'm making is [X], restructure around that"

**Too formal/casual**
Specify: "Match the tone of [publication/style]"
