## What This Does

Helps you build, expand, and maintain fictional worlds with internal consistency. Tracks magic systems, political structures, geography, history, and cultures while helping you explore "what if" scenarios.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- A folder for your world
- Creative ideas to explore

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template

Download the CLAUDE.md template below and save it to your worldbuilding folder.

### Step 2: Create Your World Structure

Set up your lore repository:

```
my-world/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── core/
│   ├── overview.md
│   ├── magic-system.md
│   └── rules.md
├── geography/
│   ├── map-notes.md
│   └── regions/
├── cultures/
│   ├── kingdom-of-varn.md
│   └── desert-nomads.md
├── history/
│   ├── timeline.md
│   └── events/
└── characters/
    └── notable-figures.md
```

### Step 3: Define Core Rules

Create your foundational `rules.md`:

```markdown
# World Rules

## Magic System
- Source: Drawn from ley lines
- Cost: Physical exhaustion
- Limits: Cannot create life
- Rare abilities: Only 1% can use

## Technology Level
- Era: Medieval + magic
- No gunpowder
- Magic-powered transportation

## Themes
- Power corrupts
- Nature vs civilization
```

### Step 4: Start Building

Begin exploring your world:

```
I want to develop the Northern Kingdom - what questions should I answer?
```

## Example Usage

```
"What would happen if magic suddenly disappeared?"
"Check if my new faction contradicts existing lore"
"Generate a history for the ancient ruins"
"What cultural practices would develop in a desert society?"
"Create connections between these two regions"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with rules** - Constraints spark creativity
2. **Document everything** - Small details matter later
3. **Check consistency** - Before adding new elements
4. **Explore implications** - "What would that mean for...?"
5. **Keep a questions list** - Things to develop later

## Worldbuilding Categories

The template helps you develop:

- **Physical**: Geography, climate, flora, fauna
- **Cultural**: Customs, religion, art, food
- **Political**: Governments, conflicts, alliances
- **Economic**: Trade, resources, currency
- **Historical**: Timeline, wars, discoveries
- **Magical/Tech**: Systems, limits, implications
