## Example

**Your draft:**
```
Remote work is better for most people. Companies that don't
offer it are going to lose talent. There's lots of research
showing this.
```

**Feedback:**

| Issue | Current | Suggestion |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Vague claim | "most people" | Specify who or add nuance |
| Unsupported | "lots of research" | Cite specific studies |
| Weak assertion | "going to lose" | Add evidence or soften |

**Revised:**
```
For knowledge workers, remote work often increases satisfaction
and productivity. According to Stanford research, companies
offering flexible arrangements see 25% lower attrition.
```

## Feedback Types

| Type | What You Get |
|------|--------------|
| **Structural** | Organization, flow, section order |
| **Argumentative** | Logic, evidence, counterarguments |
| **Clarity** | Sentence structure, word choice |
| **Style** | Tone, voice, audience fit |
| **Technical** | Grammar, punctuation, formatting |

---

## Calibrating Feedback

Tell Claude what kind of feedback you want:
- "Focus on structure, not grammar"
- "Be harsh - I want to make this excellent"
- "Quick pass for obvious issues only"
- "Match the style of [publication]"
- "This is for [audience] - is it appropriate?"

---

## Tips

- **Share your goal**: "This is for my company blog"
- **Mention audience**: "Readers are senior marketers"
- **Set the bar**: "Aiming for New Yorker quality"
- **Be specific**: "Does the transition in paragraph 3 work?"
- **Iterate**: Multiple rounds produce better results

---

## Commands

```
"Review my outline"
"What's missing from my argument?"
"Give section-by-section feedback"
"Is my introduction compelling?"
"Strengthen this paragraph"
"Make this clearer without dumbing it down"
"What counterarguments should I address?"
"Polish for publication"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Feedback is too general**
Ask: "Give me specific line-by-line suggestions for paragraph 2"

**Loses my voice**
Say: "Suggest changes but maintain my casual tone"

**Too many suggestions**
Ask: "What are the 3 highest-impact changes?"
