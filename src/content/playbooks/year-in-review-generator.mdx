## What This Does

This playbook generates a comprehensive year-in-review document by pulling data from your git history, project management tools (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues), and any local notes or documents. It compiles your accomplishments into a polished narrative perfect for performance reviews, personal reflection, or sharing with your manager. Inspired by a Reddit user who used Claude Code with the Jira MCP server and git history to create their "year wrapped" and saved it to Obsidian.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed and configured
- Git repositories you contributed to
- Optional: Jira/Linear MCP server or exported data
- Optional: Local notes, meeting docs, or email summaries

## The CLAUDE.md Template

Copy this into a `CLAUDE.md` file in your review project folder:

```markdown
# Year-in-Review Generator

## Goal
Compile my professional accomplishments from the past year into a structured, polished document. Pull data from git history, project management tools, and local notes.

## Data Sources
- `repos/` — List of git repositories to scan (paths or clone URLs)
- `exports/` — Exported data from Jira, Linear, or other tools (CSV/JSON)
- `notes/` — Meeting notes, project summaries, and other context
- `output/` — Generated review documents

## Review Document Structure

### 1. Executive Summary
- 2-3 sentence overview of the year's key accomplishments
- Quantified impact where possible (features shipped, bugs fixed, users impacted)

### 2. Key Projects
For each major project:
- **Project name and goal**
- **My role and contributions**
- **Key outcomes and impact**
- **Technologies and skills used**
- **Challenges overcome**

### 3. By the Numbers
- Commits made across all repositories
- PRs opened and reviewed
- Issues/tickets resolved
- Lines of code added/removed (if meaningful)
- Projects contributed to

### 4. Skills & Growth
- New technologies learned
- Leadership or mentorship activities
- Process improvements introduced
- Certifications or courses completed

### 5. Collaboration & Impact
- Cross-team projects
- Code reviews and mentorship
- Documentation and knowledge sharing
- Team wins I contributed to

### 6. Looking Forward
- Goals for next year
- Areas for growth
- Projects I want to tackle

## Rules
1. Focus on impact, not just activity (features shipped > commits made)
2. Use specific numbers and dates where available
3. Group accomplishments by project or theme, not chronologically
4. Highlight leadership and collaboration, not just individual work
5. Write in first person, professional tone
6. Include specific examples and outcomes for each accomplishment

## Commands
- "/scan repos" — Analyze git history across listed repositories
- "/scan exports" — Process Jira/Linear export data
- "/generate" — Create the full year-in-review document
- "/highlight [project]" — Deep dive into a specific project's contributions
- "/stats" — Generate the "by the numbers" section
- "/draft review" — Create a performance review self-assessment draft
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create the project structure

```bash
mkdir -p ~/year-review/{repos,exports,notes,output}
cd ~/year-review
```

### Step 2: List your repositories

Create `repos/repositories.md`:
```
# Repositories to Scan

- /path/to/work/repo-1
- /path/to/work/repo-2
- /path/to/personal/side-project

Git author email: your.email@company.com
Date range: 2025-01-01 to 2025-12-31
```

### Step 3: Export project management data (optional)

If you use Jira, export your completed issues as CSV. For Linear, export from Settings → Data Export. Place files in `exports/`.

Alternatively, if you have the Jira MCP server installed, Claude can query it directly.

### Step 4: Add any notes or context

Place meeting notes, project briefs, or personal notes in `notes/`. The more context Claude has, the richer the review.

### Step 5: Save CLAUDE.md and generate

```bash
cd ~/year-review
claude
```

Try: "/scan repos" then "/generate"

## Example Usage

**Scan your git contributions:**
> "/scan repos — Analyze my git history across all listed repositories for 2025. Show me commits by month, PRs, and key files touched."

**Process Jira data:**
> "/scan exports — Read the Jira CSV export and categorize my completed tickets by project, priority, and type (feature, bug, task)."

**Generate the full review:**
> "/generate — Create a comprehensive year-in-review document. Use data from git history, Jira exports, and my notes folder. Focus on impact and outcomes."

**Deep dive into a project:**
> "/highlight API Migration — Pull all my contributions to the API migration project. Include commits, PRs, issues resolved, and any notes about it."

**Quick stats:**
> "/stats — Generate a by-the-numbers summary: total commits, PRs, issues closed, repos contributed to, and any other quantifiable metrics."

**Performance review draft:**
> "/draft review — Using the year-in-review data, draft a performance review self-assessment. Organize by company competencies: technical excellence, collaboration, leadership, and impact."

## Tips

- **Do this quarterly, not just annually**: Run a mini-review each quarter so you have fresh accomplishments documented. Annual reviews are easier when you've been tracking all year.
- **Git history tells a story**: Claude can identify your biggest contributions, busiest periods, and collaboration patterns from git logs alone.
- **Quantify impact**: "Shipped feature X" is good. "Shipped feature X, reducing page load time by 40% for 10K daily users" is much better. Add impact context in your notes folder.
- **Save to Obsidian**: The generated document works perfectly as a markdown note in Obsidian, where you can link it to project notes and meeting summaries.
- **Include soft contributions**: Code reviews, mentorship, documentation, and process improvements are often the most valued accomplishments. Add notes about these.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Git log shows too many commits to process

**Solution**: Filter by author email and date range. Claude can run `git log --author="your@email.com" --since="2025-01-01" --until="2025-12-31" --oneline` to get a focused list.

**Problem**: Jira export is too large

**Solution**: Filter the CSV to only your assigned issues before importing. Most Jira exports include filters — use "assignee = currentUser() AND resolved >= 2025-01-01".

**Problem**: Review feels like a list of tasks, not accomplishments

**Solution**: For each item, ask Claude to rewrite it focusing on impact: "What problem did this solve? Who benefited? What was the outcome?" Transform activity into achievement.
